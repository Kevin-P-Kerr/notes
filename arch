"The surface of any isoscles cone excluding the base is equal to a circle whose radius
is mean proportional between the side of the cone and the radius of the circle which is the base of the cone."

A = the base of the cone
C = the radius of A
D = the side of the cone
E = sqrt(C*D)
B = circle with radius E
(hypotheis) B = S = surface of cone - base
if (not hypothesis) then either B>S || B<S
suppose B<S
E = regular polygon inscribed in B, F = regular polygon circumscribed about in B, such that 
E:F < B:S
G = polygon about A, such that G:A = F:B
H = pyramid upon G with an apex equal to that of the cone
then
G:F = C^2:E^2 (?) = C:D (C^2/(CD) = C/D) = G:(surface of pyramid exluding base)
therefore
(surface of pyramid (exluding base?)) = F
(surface of pyarmid):E < S:B, which is impossible, for 
B>E
(surface of pyramid)>S


SP/E < S/B implies that either SP < S or E>B, neither of which is true

so B is not less then S

then say that B > S
E,F = polygons circum/in such that E:F < B:S
G = inscribed in A such that G is similar to F

Definition 1: concave (lines) in the same direction
Definition 2: concave (planes) in the same direction
Definition 3: a solid sector is a the figure by the apex of a cone cutting a sphere at its center, including the surface of the sphere contained within the cone
Definition 4: a solid rhombus is the figure comprehended by a two cones which share a base, and whose apices lies on the same axis
Assumption 1: Of all lines which have the same extremity, the straight line is the least
Assumption 2: Of two concave straightlines, the lesser is the one which is included in the greater
Assumption 3: (1) same of planes
Asuumption 4: (2) of planes
Assumption 5: of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal solids, the difference between the 
lesser and greater may, by addition with itself, be made to surpass any assigned magnitude

Proposition 1. if a polygon be circumscribed about a circle, the perimeter of the polygon is greater
than the circumference of the circle
Proposotion 2. given two unequal magnitudes, it is possible to find two straightlines such that 
the greater straightline has to the lesser a ratio less less than the greater magnitude to the lesser.
  let AB, D be the magnitudes, AB > D
  BC = D
  GH a straightlines
  N = the smallest integer such that N(CA) > D
  AF = N(CA)
  ACBF; BC=D, AF>D, AF=N(CA)
  GHE; GH = N(HE)
  HE:GH = AC:AF
  therefore, since AF>D
  AC:AF < AC:BC
  therefore
  HE:GH < AC:BC
  and, since AC < AB
  HE:GH < AB:BC, as required

Proposition 3: Given two unequal magnitudes and a circle, it is possible
to inscribe a polygon in the circle and describe a polygon about the circle
such that the side of the circumscribed polygon may have to the side of the inscribed
polygon a ratio less than the greater magnitude to the less
  A>B
  F,KL such that F:KL < A:B, F>KL (II)
  ML is perpendicular to LK, and KM=F
  CE,DG are two diameters of the circle
  Let O be the center of the circle
  then bisect the angle DOC continously till there is an angle less than 1/2(LKM), call this NOC
  join NC.  then NC is the side of a regular polygon in the circle
  OHP, a radius of the circle bisecting NOC at H
  then OS,OT are extension of OC,ON such that they contain the tangent at P
  #CON < 2 < #LKM
  #HOC < #LKM
  the angles at H are right
  the angle at L is right
  MK:LK > OC:OH (why?, because all right angled triangles are similar)
  MK:LK > OP:OH
  ST:CN < MK:LK
  ST:CN < F:KL < A:B, as required

Proposition 4: The same as 3, but for sectors

Proposition 5: Given a circle and two unequal magnitudes, to describe a 
polygon about the circle and to inscribe another within it, so that the
circumscribed polygon has to the inscribed polygon a ratio less than the greater mag. to the lessera

Proposition 6: The same as 5, but for sectors

Proposition 7: If in an isosceles cone a pyramid be inscribed having an equilateral base, the surface
of the pyramid excluding its base is equal to a triangle having its base equal to the perimeter
of the base of the pyramid and its height equal to the perpendicular drawn from the apex on one side of the base.

Proposition 8: If a pyramid be circumscribed about an isosceles cone, the surface of the pyramid
excluding its base is equal to a triangle having its base equal to the permieter of the base of the pyramid
and its height equal to the side of the cone.

Proposition 9: If in the circular base of an isosceles cone a chord be placed, and from
its extremities straight lines be drawn to the apex of the cone, the triangle so formed 
will be less than the portion of the surface of the cone intercepted between the lines drawn to the apex.

    ABC = the circular base of the cone
    O = the apex
    AB = the chord in ABC
    OAB = the triangle
    C = the point of bisection of arc(AB)
    AC,BC,OC
    tri(OAC)+tri(OBC) > OAB
    D = tri(OAC)+tri(OBC)-OAB
    AEC,CFB = segments in the circle
    D is either less than AEC+CFB, or not
    .... (if D is not less, the proof is relatively easy)
    say that D is less
    D < AEC+CFB
    AGE,EHC,CKF,FLB are segments less than D, and they are equal to one another
    OE,OF are lines

Proposition 10: If in the plane of an isosceles cone two tangents be drawn to the circle
meeting in a point, and the points of contact and the point of concourse of the tangents be respectively
joined to the apex of the cone, the sum of the two triangles formed by joining the lines and the two tangents
are together greater than the included portion of the surface of the cone.
  ABC = the circular base of the cone
  O = the apex of the cone
  AD,BD tangents on ABC meeting at D
  OAD,OBD, the two triangles
  C, the middle point of arc ABC
  ECF, a tangent at C
  OE,OF
  ED+DF > EF
  AD+BD > AE + EF + FB
  OA = OC = OB
  tri(OAD) + tri(OBD) > OAE + OEF  + OFB
  G = tri(OAD) + tri(OBD) - OAE + OEF  + OFB

Proposition 11:
  If a plane paralell to the surface of a right cylinder cut the cylinder, the part of the surface of the cylinder cut off by the plane is greater than the area of the parallelogram in which the plane cuts it.

Proposition 12: 
  If at the extremities of two generators of any right cylinder tangents be drawn to the circular bases in the planes of those bases repsectively, and if the pairs of tangents meet, the parallelograms formed by each generator and the two corresponding tangents respectively are together greater than the included portion of the surface of the cylinder between the two generators. 

Proposition 13:
  The surface of any right cylinder excluding the base is equal to a circle whose radius is a mean proportional between the side of the cylinder and and the diameter of its base

  A = circle
  CD = diameter of the cylinder 
  EF = height of the cylinder
  H = mean proportional between CD and EF
  B = circle with diameter H e.g. sqrt(CD*EF)
  B = area of the cylinder exluding the bases = S
  if not
    B<S or B>S
  suppose B < S

Proposition 14
  The surface of any isosceles cone excluding the base is equal to a circle whose radius is mean proportional between the side of the side of the cone and the radius of the circle which is the base of the cone.
    A = base of the cone
    C = line equal to the radius of A
    D = line equal to the side of the cone
    E = line mean proportional to C and D
    B = circle with radius E
    S = area of A excluding the base
    suppose B<S
