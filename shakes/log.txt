shakes.txt:8512:    Her head's declin'd, and death will seize her but
shakes.txt-8513-    Your comfort makes the rescue.
shakes.txt-8514-  ANTONY. I have offended reputation-
shakes.txt-8515-    A most unnoble swerving.

shakes.txt-8850-  ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
shakes.txt-8851-    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,

shakes.txt-8854-    Even with his pestilent scythe.     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS

shakes.txt-8941-    And the gods yield you for't!
shakes.txt-8942-  ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir,
--
--
shakes.txt-8951-    To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,  
shakes.txt-8952-    I hope well of to-morrow, and will lead you
shakes.txt-8953-    Where rather I'll expect victorious life
shakes.txt:8954:    Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
shakes.txt-8955-    And drown consideration.                              Exeunt

shakes.txt-9288-  FIRST WATCH. Go we to him.
shakes.txt-9289-  SECOND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
shakes.txt-9290-  FIRST WATCH. Hear you, sir?  
shakes.txt:9291:  CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him.
shakes.txt-9292-    [Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums
shakes.txt-9293-    Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
shakes.txt-9294-    To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
--
--
shakes.txt-9381-    With her prepared nails.                      Exit CLEOPATRA
shakes.txt-9382-    'Tis well th'art gone,
shakes.txt-9383-    If it be well to live; but better 'twere
shakes.txt:9384:    Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
shakes.txt-9385-    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
shakes.txt-9386-    The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
shakes.txt-9387-    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage;
--
--
shakes.txt-9408-    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
shakes.txt-9409-    Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony'
shakes.txt-9410-    And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
shakes.txt:9411:    And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
shakes.txt-9412-                                                          Exeunt

--
--
shakes.txt-9451-    My mistress lov'd thee, and her fortunes mingled
shakes.txt-9452-    With thine entirely.
shakes.txt-9453-  ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
shakes.txt:9454:    She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death.
shakes.txt:9455:  MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once,
shakes.txt-9456-    And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do  
shakes.txt-9457-    Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake
shakes.txt-9458-    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
--
--
shakes.txt-9493-    Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
shakes.txt-9494-    With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
shakes.txt-9495-    The courage of a woman; less noble mind
shakes.txt:9496:    Than she which by her death our Caesar tells  
shakes.txt-9497-    'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
shakes.txt-9498-    That, when the exigent should come- which now
shakes.txt-9499-    Is come indeed- when I should see behind me
--
--
shakes.txt-9534-  EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
shakes.txt-9535-  ANTONY. Now, Eros.
shakes.txt-9536-  EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow  
shakes.txt:9537:    Of Antony's death.                            [Kills himself
shakes.txt-9538-  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
shakes.txt-9539-    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
shakes.txt-9540-    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
--
--
shakes.txt-9540-    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
shakes.txt-9541-    Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
shakes.txt-9542-    A nobleness in record. But I will be
shakes.txt:9543:    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
shakes.txt-9544-    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
shakes.txt-9545-    Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus
shakes.txt-9546-                                          [Falling on his sword]

shakes.txt-9561-  THIRD GUARD. Nor any one.                         Exeunt guard
shakes.txt:9562:  DERCETAS. Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
shakes.txt-9563-    This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
shakes.txt-9564-    Shall enter me with him.
shakes.txt-9565-
--
--
shakes.txt-9570-  DIOMEDES. Lives he?
shakes.txt-9571-    Wilt thou not answer, man?                     Exit DERCETAS
shakes.txt-9572-  ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
shakes.txt:9573:    Sufficing strokes for death.
shakes.txt-9574-  DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord,
shakes.txt-9575-    My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
shakes.txt-9576-  ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
--
--
shakes.txt-9619-                   Enter DIOMEDES, below
shakes.txt-9620-
shakes.txt-9621-    How now! Is he dead?
shakes.txt:9622:  DIOMEDES. His death's upon him, but not dead.
shakes.txt-9623-    Look out o' th' other side your monument;
shakes.txt-9624-    His guard have brought him thither.
shakes.txt-9625-
--
--
shakes.txt-9636-  CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony
shakes.txt-9637-    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
shakes.txt-9638-  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
shakes.txt:9639:    I here importune death awhile, until
shakes.txt-9640-    Of many thousand kisses the poor last
shakes.txt-9641-    I lay upon thy lips.
shakes.txt-9642-  CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear.
--
--
shakes.txt-9708-    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but nought;
shakes.txt-9709-    Patience is sottish, and impatience does
shakes.txt-9710-    Become a dog that's mad. Then is it sin
shakes.txt:9711:    To rush into the secret house of death
shakes.txt:9712:    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
shakes.txt-9713-    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
shakes.txt-9714-    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
shakes.txt-9715-    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
--
--
shakes.txt-9715-    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart.
shakes.txt-9716-    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
shakes.txt-9717-    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
shakes.txt:9718:    And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
shakes.txt-9719-    This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
shakes.txt-9720-    Ah, women, women! Come; we have no friend
shakes.txt-9721-    But resolution and the briefest end.
--
--
shakes.txt-9750-  CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make
shakes.txt-9751-    A greater crack. The round world
shakes.txt-9752-    Should have shook lions into civil streets,
shakes.txt:9753:    And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
shakes.txt-9754-    Is not a single doom; in the name lay
shakes.txt-9755-    A moiety of the world.
shakes.txt-9756-  DERCETAS. He is dead, Caesar,
--
--
shakes.txt-9888-  PROCULEIUS. Hold, worthy lady, hold,             [Disarms her]
shakes.txt-9889-    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
shakes.txt-9890-    Reliev'd, but not betray'd.  
shakes.txt:9891:  CLEOPATRA. What, of death too,
shakes.txt-9892-    That rids our dogs of languish?
shakes.txt-9893-  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,
shakes.txt-9894-    Do not abuse my master's bounty by

--
shakes.txt-9893-  PROCULEIUS. Cleopatra,
shakes.txt-9894-    Do not abuse my master's bounty by
shakes.txt-9895-    Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see
shakes.txt:9896:    His nobleness well acted, which your death
shakes.txt-9897-    Will never let come forth.
--
shakes.txt-9897-    Will never let come forth.
shakes.txt:9898:  CLEOPATRA. Where art thou, death?
shakes.txt-9899-    Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
shakes.txt-9900-    Worth many babes and beggars!
shakes.txt-9901-  PROCULEIUS. O, temperance, lady!

--
shakes.txt-10205-                              [Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
shakes.txt-10206-    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
shakes.txt-10207-    If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
shakes.txt:10208:    The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
shakes.txt-10209-    Which hurts and is desir'd. Dost thou lie still?
shakes.txt-10210-    If thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world  
shakes.txt-10211-    It is not worth leave-taking.
--
--
shakes.txt-10231-                               [Applying another asp to her arm]
shakes.txt-10232-    What should I stay-                                   [Dies]
shakes.txt-10233-  CHARMIAN. In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
shakes.txt:10234:    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
shakes.txt-10235-    A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
shakes.txt-10236-    And golden Phoebus never be beheld
shakes.txt-10237-    Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
--
--
shakes.txt-10267-    That you did fear is done.
shakes.txt-10268-  CAESAR. Bravest at the last,
shakes.txt-10269-    She levell'd at our purposes, and being royal,
shakes.txt:10270:    Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?  
shakes.txt-10271-    I do not see them bleed.
shakes.txt-10272-  DOLABELLA. Who was last with them?
shakes.txt-10273-  FIRST GUARD. A simple countryman that brought her figs.
--
--
shakes.txt-11244-  TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
shakes.txt-11245-  CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
shakes.txt-11246-    If he for gold will give us any food;
shakes.txt:11247:    I faint almost to death.
shakes.txt-11248-  TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
shakes.txt-11249-  ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
shakes.txt-11250-  CORIN. Who calls?
--
--
shakes.txt-11372-  ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
shakes.txt-11373-    little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
shakes.txt-11374-    forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
shakes.txt:11375:    bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
shakes.txt:11376:    powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
shakes.txt-11377-    arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
shakes.txt-11378-    not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
shakes.txt-11379-    diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
--
--
shakes.txt-12212-  SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
shakes.txt-12213-    Say that you love me not; but say not so
shakes.txt-12214-    In bitterness. The common executioner,
shakes.txt:12215:    Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
shakes.txt-12216-    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
shakes.txt-12217-    But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
shakes.txt-12218-    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
--
--
shakes.txt-12532-  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
shakes.txt-12533-    prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That
shakes.txt-12534-    flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and  
shakes.txt:12535:    so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
shakes.txt-12536-  ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
shakes.txt-12537-  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
shakes.txt-12538-    by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
--
--
shakes.txt-12869-    woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
shakes.txt-12870-    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
shakes.txt-12871-    or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
shakes.txt:12872:    death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
shakes.txt-12873-    or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
shakes.txt-12874-    will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
shakes.txt-12875-    fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
--
--
shakes.txt-13089-    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
shakes.txt-13090-  PHEBE. So is the bargain.
shakes.txt-13091-  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
shakes.txt:13092:  SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
shakes.txt-13093-  ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
shakes.txt-13094-    Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
shakes.txt-13095-    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
--
--
shakes.txt-13375-of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS
shakes.txt-13376-
shakes.txt-13377-AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
shakes.txt:13378:  And by the doom of death end woes and all.
shakes.txt-13379-DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
shakes.txt-13380-  I am not partial to infringe our laws.
shakes.txt-13381-  The enmity and discord which of late
--
--
shakes.txt-13414-  And by me, had not our hap been bad.
shakes.txt-13415-  With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
shakes.txt-13416-  By prosperous voyages I often made
shakes.txt:13417:  To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
shakes.txt-13418-  And the great care of goods at random left,
shakes.txt-13419-  Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
shakes.txt-13420-  From whom my absence was not six months old,
--
--
shakes.txt-13441-  But longer did we not retain much hope,
shakes.txt-13442-  For what obscured light the heavens did grant
shakes.txt-13443-  Did but convey unto our fearful minds
shakes.txt:13444:  A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
shakes.txt-13445-  Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
shakes.txt-13446-  Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
shakes.txt-13447-  Weeping before for what she saw must come,
--
--
shakes.txt-13511-  Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
shakes.txt-13512-  Or that or any place that harbours men.
shakes.txt-13513-  But here must end the story of my life;
shakes.txt:13514:  And happy were I in my timely death,
shakes.txt-13515-  Could all my travels warrant me they live.
shakes.txt-13516-DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
shakes.txt-13517-  To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
--
--
shakes.txt-13519-  Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
shakes.txt-13520-  Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
shakes.txt-13521-  My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
shakes.txt:13522:  But though thou art adjudged to the death,
shakes.txt-13523-  And passed sentence may not be recall'd
shakes.txt-13524-  But to our honour's great disparagement,
shakes.txt-13525-  Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
--
--
shakes.txt-14262-  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
shakes.txt-14263-  And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
shakes.txt-14264-  And in that glorious supposition think
shakes.txt:14265:  He gains by death that hath such means to die.
shakes.txt-14266-  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.
shakes.txt-14267-LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
shakes.txt-14268-ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

shakes.txt-15091-SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
shakes.txt-15092-  Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
shakes.txt-15093-  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
shakes.txt:15094:  The place of death and sorry execution,
shakes.txt-15095-  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
shakes.txt-15096-ANGELO. Upon what cause?
shakes.txt-15097-SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
--
--
shakes.txt-15098-  Who put unluckily into this bay
shakes.txt-15099-  Against the laws and statutes of this town,
shakes.txt-15100-  Beheaded publicly for his offence.
shakes.txt:15101:ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
shakes.txt-15102-LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.
shakes.txt-15103-
shakes.txt-15104-Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;

shakes.txt-15176-  When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
shakes.txt-15177-  Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
shakes.txt-15178-  That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
shakes.txt:15179:AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
shakes.txt-15180-  I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
shakes.txt-15181-ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
shakes.txt-15182-  She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
--
--
shakes.txt-15721-  MENENIUS. What is granted them?
shakes.txt-15722-  MARCIUS. Five tribunes, to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
shakes.txt-15723-    Of their own choice. One's Junius Brutus-
shakes.txt:15724:    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not. 'Sdeath!
shakes.txt-15725-    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
shakes.txt-15726-    Ere so prevail'd with me; it will in time
shakes.txt-15727-    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
--
--
shakes.txt-16194-  COMINIUS. Flower of warriors,
shakes.txt-16195-    How is't with Titus Lartius?
shakes.txt-16196-  MARCIUS. As with a man busied about decrees:
shakes.txt:16197:    Condemning some to death and some to exile;
shakes.txt-16198-    Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other;
shakes.txt-16199-    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
shakes.txt-16200-    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
--
--
shakes.txt-16238-    As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting
shakes.txt-16239-    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
shakes.txt-16240-    Lesser his person than an ill report;
shakes.txt:16241:    If any think brave death outweighs bad life
shakes.txt-16242-    And that his country's dearer than himself;
shakes.txt-16243-    Let him alone, or so many so minded,
shakes.txt-16244-    Wave thus to express his disposition,
--
--
shakes.txt-16356-    To hear themselves rememb'red.  
shakes.txt-16357-  COMINIUS. Should they not,
shakes.txt-16358-    Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
shakes.txt:16359:    And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
shakes.txt-16360-    Whereof we have ta'en good, and good store- of all
shakes.txt-16361-    The treasure in this field achiev'd and city,
shakes.txt-16362-    We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth

--
shakes.txt-16636-    [A shout and flourish]  Hark! the trumpets.
shakes.txt-16637-  VOLUMNIA. These are the ushers of Marcius. Before him he carries
shakes.txt-16638-      noise, and behind him he leaves tears;
shakes.txt:16639:    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie,
shakes.txt-16640-    Which, being advanc'd, declines, and then men die.

shakes.txt-16642-            A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

shakes.txt-16915-    And by his rare example made the coward
shakes.txt-16916-    Turn terror into sport; as weeds before
shakes.txt-16917-    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
shakes.txt:16918:    And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
shakes.txt-16919-    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
shakes.txt-16920-    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
shakes.txt-16921-    Was tim'd with dying cries. Alone he ent'red

--
shakes.txt-17494-    More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer
shakes.txt-17495-    A noble life before a long, and wish
shakes.txt-17496-    To jump a body with a dangerous physic
shakes.txt:17497:    That's sure of death without it- at once pluck out
shakes.txt-17498-    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
shakes.txt-17499-    The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour
shakes.txt-17500-    Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state

shakes.txt-17564-    To bring the roof to the foundation,
shakes.txt-17565-    And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
shakes.txt-17566-    In heaps and piles of ruin.
shakes.txt:17567:  SICINIUS. This deserves death.

shakes.txt:17681:    Our certain death; therefore it is decreed

shakes.txt-24300-    'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
shakes.txt-24301-    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
--
--
shakes.txt-24686-    That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
shakes.txt-24687-    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
shakes.txt-24688-    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
shakes.txt:24689:    Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
shakes.txt-24690-    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
shakes.txt-24691-    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
shakes.txt-24692-    Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
--
--
shakes.txt-24792-    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
shakes.txt-24793-    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
shakes.txt-24794-    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
shakes.txt:24795:    Is by a forged process of my death
shakes.txt-24796-    Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
shakes.txt-24797-    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
shakes.txt-24798-    Now wears his crown.
--
--
shakes.txt-25138-    Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
shakes.txt-25139-    Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
shakes.txt-25140-    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
shakes.txt:25141:    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
shakes.txt-25142-    So much from th' understanding of himself,
shakes.txt-25143-    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
shakes.txt-25144-    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
--
--
shakes.txt-25196-    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
shakes.txt-25197-    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
shakes.txt-25198-  Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
shakes.txt:25199:    His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
shakes.txt-25200-  King. Well, we shall sift him.
shakes.txt-25201-
shakes.txt-25202-              Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.
--
--
shakes.txt-25641-      But, as we often see, against some storm,
shakes.txt-25642-      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
shakes.txt-25643-      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
shakes.txt:25644:      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
shakes.txt-25645-      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
shakes.txt-25646-      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
shakes.txt-25647-      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
--
--
shakes.txt-25684-  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
shakes.txt-25685-    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
shakes.txt-25686-    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
shakes.txt:25687:    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
shakes.txt-25688-    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
shakes.txt-25689-  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
shakes.txt-25690-  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
--
--
shakes.txt-25865-    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
shakes.txt-25866-    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
shakes.txt-25867-    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
shakes.txt:25868:    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
shakes.txt-25869-    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
shakes.txt-25870-    Must give us pause. There's the respect
shakes.txt-25871-    That makes calamity of so long life.
--
--
shakes.txt-25877-    When he himself might his quietus make
shakes.txt-25878-    With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
shakes.txt-25879-    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
shakes.txt:25880:    But that the dread of something after death-
shakes.txt-25881-    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
shakes.txt-25882-    No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
shakes.txt-25883-    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
--
--
shakes.txt-26075-    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
shakes.txt-26076-    There is a play to-night before the King.
shakes.txt-26077-    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
shakes.txt:26078:    Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
shakes.txt-26079-    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
shakes.txt-26080-    Even with the very comment of thy soul
shakes.txt-26081-    Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
--
--
shakes.txt-26511-    To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
shakes.txt-26512-    Try what repentance can. What can it not?
shakes.txt-26513-    Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
shakes.txt:26514:    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
shakes.txt-26515-    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
shakes.txt-26516-    Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
shakes.txt-26517-    Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
--
--
shakes.txt-26756-    To punish me with this, and this with me,
shakes.txt-26757-    That I must be their scourge and minister.
shakes.txt-26758-    I will bestow him, and will answer well
shakes.txt:26759:    The death I gave him. So again, good night.
shakes.txt-26760-    I must be cruel, only to be kind;
shakes.txt-26761-    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
shakes.txt-26762-    One word more, good lady.
--
--
shakes.txt-26998-    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
shakes.txt-26999-    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
shakes.txt-27000-    By letters congruing to that effect,
shakes.txt:27001:    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
shakes.txt-27002-    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
shakes.txt-27003-    And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
shakes.txt-27004-    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
--
--
shakes.txt-27080-    Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
shakes.txt-27081-    Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
shakes.txt-27082-    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
shakes.txt:27083:    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
shakes.txt-27084-    Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
shakes.txt-27085-    Is not to stir without great argument,
shakes.txt-27086-    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
--
--
shakes.txt-27088-    That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
shakes.txt-27089-    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
shakes.txt-27090-    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
shakes.txt:27091:    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
shakes.txt-27092-    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
shakes.txt-27093-    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
shakes.txt-27094-    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
--
--
shakes.txt-27213-  King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
shakes.txt-27214-                                                 [Exit Horatio.]  
shakes.txt-27215-    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
shakes.txt:27216:    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
shakes.txt-27217-    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
shakes.txt-27218-    But in battalions! First, her father slain;
shakes.txt-27219-    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
--
--
shakes.txt-27219-    Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
shakes.txt-27220-    Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
shakes.txt-27221-    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
shakes.txt:27222:    For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
shakes.txt-27223-    In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
shakes.txt-27224-    Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
shakes.txt-27225-    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
--
--
shakes.txt-27227-    Her brother is in secret come from France;
shakes.txt-27228-    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
shakes.txt-27229-    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
shakes.txt:27230:    With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
shakes.txt-27231-    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
shakes.txt-27232-    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
shakes.txt-27233-    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
--
--
shakes.txt-27232-    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
shakes.txt-27233-    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
shakes.txt-27234-    Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
shakes.txt:27235:    Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
shakes.txt-27236-  Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
shakes.txt-27237-  King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
shakes.txt-27238-
--
--
shakes.txt-27294-    They shall go far with little.  
shakes.txt-27295-  King. Good Laertes,
shakes.txt-27296-    If you desire to know the certainty
shakes.txt:27297:    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
shakes.txt-27298-    That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
shakes.txt-27299-    Winner and loser?
shakes.txt-27300-  Laer. None but his enemies.
--
--
shakes.txt-27304-    Repast them with my blood.
shakes.txt-27305-  King. Why, now You speak
shakes.txt-27306-    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
shakes.txt:27307:    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
shakes.txt-27308-    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
shakes.txt-27309-    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
shakes.txt-27310-    As day does to your eye.
--
--
shakes.txt-27353-         And will he not come again?
shakes.txt-27354-         And will he not come again?
shakes.txt-27355-           No, no, he is dead;  
shakes.txt:27356:           Go to thy deathbed;
shakes.txt-27357-         He never will come again.
shakes.txt-27358-
shakes.txt-27359-         His beard was as white as snow,
--
--
shakes.txt-27377-    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
shakes.txt-27378-    To give it due content.
shakes.txt-27379-  Laer. Let this be so.
shakes.txt:27380:    His means of death, his obscure funeral-
shakes.txt-27381-    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
shakes.txt-27382-    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
shakes.txt-27383-    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
--
--
shakes.txt-27429-    alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
shakes.txt-27430-    of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
shakes.txt-27431-    them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
shakes.txt:27432:    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
shakes.txt-27433-    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
shakes.txt-27434-    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
shakes.txt-27435-    thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
--
--
shakes.txt-27534-    No more to undertake it, I will work him
shakes.txt-27535-    To exploit now ripe in my device,
shakes.txt-27536-    Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
shakes.txt:27537:    And for his death no wind
shakes.txt-27538-    But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
shakes.txt-27539-    And call it accident.
shakes.txt-27540-  Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
--
--
shakes.txt-27622-    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
shakes.txt-27623-    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
shakes.txt-27624-    Collected from all simples that have virtue
shakes.txt:27625:    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
shakes.txt-27626-    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
shakes.txt-27627-    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
--
shakes.txt-27626-    This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
shakes.txt-27627-    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
shakes.txt:27628:    It may be death.
shakes.txt-27629-  King. Let's further think of this,
shakes.txt-27630-    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
shakes.txt-27631-    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
--
--
shakes.txt-27665-    Unto that element; but long it could not be
shakes.txt-27666-    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
shakes.txt-27667-    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
shakes.txt:27668:    To muddy death.
shakes.txt-27669-  Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
shakes.txt-27670-  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
shakes.txt-27671-  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
--
--
shakes.txt-27716-    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
shakes.txt-27717-    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
shakes.txt-27718-    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
shakes.txt:27719:    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
shakes.txt-27720-  Other. But is this law?
shakes.txt-27721-  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
shakes.txt-27722-  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
--
--
shakes.txt-27923-    A very noble youth. Mark.
shakes.txt-27924-  Laer. What ceremony else?
shakes.txt-27925-  Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
shakes.txt:27926:    As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
shakes.txt-27927-    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
shakes.txt-27928-    She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
shakes.txt-27929-    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
--
--
shakes.txt-28071-    And many such-like as's of great charge,
shakes.txt-28072-    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
shakes.txt-28073-    Without debatement further, more or less,
shakes.txt:28074:    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
shakes.txt-28075-    Not shriving time allow'd.
shakes.txt-28076-  Hor. How was this seal'd?
shakes.txt-28077-  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
--
--
shakes.txt-28370-  Laer. He is justly serv'd.
shakes.txt-28371-    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
shakes.txt-28372-    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
shakes.txt:28373:    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
shakes.txt-28374-    Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
shakes.txt-28375-  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
shakes.txt-28376-    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
--
--
shakes.txt-28376-    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
shakes.txt-28377-    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
shakes.txt-28378-    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
shakes.txt:28379:    Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
shakes.txt-28380-    Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
shakes.txt-28381-    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
shakes.txt-28382-    Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
--
--
shakes.txt-28414-  Fort. Where is this sight?
shakes.txt-28415-  Hor. What is it you will see?
shakes.txt-28416-    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
shakes.txt:28417:  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
shakes.txt-28418-    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
shakes.txt-28419-    That thou so many princes at a shot
shakes.txt-28420-    So bloodily hast struck.
--
--
shakes.txt-28426-    Where should We have our thanks?
shakes.txt-28427-  Hor. Not from his mouth,
shakes.txt-28428-    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
shakes.txt:28429:    He never gave commandment for their death.
shakes.txt-28430-    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
shakes.txt-28431-    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
shakes.txt-28432-    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
--
--
shakes.txt-28435-    How these things came about. So shall You hear
shakes.txt-28436-    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
shakes.txt-28437-    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
shakes.txt:28438:    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
shakes.txt-28439-    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
shakes.txt-28440-    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
shakes.txt-28441-    Truly deliver.
--
--
shakes.txt-29002-  Hot. He will (forsooth) have all my prisoners;
shakes.txt-29003-    And when I urg'd the ransom once again
shakes.txt-29004-    Of my wive's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
shakes.txt:29005:    And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
shakes.txt-29006-    Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
shakes.txt-29007-  Wor. I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaim'd
shakes.txt-29008-    By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?
--
--
shakes.txt-29012-    Upon his Irish expedition;
shakes.txt-29013-    From whence he intercepted did return
shakes.txt-29014-    To be depos'd, and shortly murdered.
shakes.txt:29015:  Wor. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
shakes.txt-29016-    Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of.
shakes.txt-29017-  Hot. But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then
shakes.txt-29018-    Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
--
--
shakes.txt-29046-    Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
shakes.txt-29047-    Of this proud king, who studies day and night
shakes.txt-29048-    To answer all the debt he owes to you
shakes.txt:29049:    Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.
shakes.txt-29050-    Therefore I say-
shakes.txt-29051-  Wor. Peace, cousin, say no more;  
shakes.txt-29052-    And now, I will unclasp a secret book,
--
--
shakes.txt-29137-    The Archbishop.
shakes.txt-29138-  Hot. Of York, is it not?
shakes.txt-29139-  Wor. True; who bears hard
shakes.txt:29140:    His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.
shakes.txt-29141-    I speak not this in estimation,
shakes.txt-29142-    As what I think might be, but what I know
shakes.txt-29143-    Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
--
--
shakes.txt-29203-    next way to give poor jades the bots. This house is turned upside
shakes.txt-29204-    down since Robin Ostler died.
shakes.txt-29205-  1. Car. Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose. It
shakes.txt:29206:    was the death of him.
shakes.txt-29207-  2. Car. I think this be the most villanous house in all London road
shakes.txt-29208-    for fleas. I am stung like a tench.
shakes.txt-29209-  1. Car. Like a tench I By the mass, there is ne'er a king christen

--
shakes.txt-29306-  Fal. I am accurs'd to rob in that thief's company. The rascal hath
shakes.txt-29307-    removed my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travel but
shakes.txt-29308-    four foot by the squire further afoot, I shall break my wind.
shakes.txt:29309:    Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
shakes.txt-29310-    scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company  
shakes.txt-29311-    hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitch'd
shakes.txt-29312-    with the rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me
--
--
shakes.txt-29408-    The thieves are scattered, and possess'd with fear
shakes.txt-29409-    So strongly that they dare not meet each other.
shakes.txt-29410-    Each takes his fellow for an officer.  
shakes.txt:29411:    Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death
shakes.txt-29412-    And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
shakes.txt-29413-    Were't not for laughing, I should pity him.
shakes.txt-29414-  Poins. How the rogue roar'd!                           Exeunt.
--
--
shakes.txt-30063-    read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I'll to
shakes.txt-30064-    the court in the morning . We must all to the wars. and thy place
shakes.txt-30065-    shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of
shakes.txt:30066:    foot; and I know, his death will be a march of twelve score. The
shakes.txt-30067-    money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes
shakes.txt-30068-    in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto.
shakes.txt-30069-  Peto. Good morrow, good my lord.

shakes.txt-30533-    I do beseech your Majesty may salve  
shakes.txt-30534-    The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.
shakes.txt-30535-    If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
shakes.txt:30536:    And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
shakes.txt-30537-    Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
shakes.txt-30538-  King. A hundred thousand rebels die in this!

shakes.txt-30592-  Bard. Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
shakes.txt-30593-  Fal. No, I'll be sworn. I make as good use of it as many a man doth
shakes.txt:30594:    of a death's-head or a memento mori. I never see thy face but I
shakes.txt-30595-    think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he
shakes.txt-30596-    is in his robes, burning, burning. if thou wert any way given to
shakes.txt-30597-    virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be 'By this

shakes.txt-30923-    Come, let us take a muster speedily.
shakes.txt-30924-    Doomsday is near. Die all, die merrily.
shakes.txt-30925-  Doug. Talk not of dying. I am out of fear
shakes.txt:30926:    Of death or death's hand for this one half-year.
shakes.txt-30927-                                                         Exeunt.

shakes.txt-31349-  Prince. Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship.
shakes.txt-31350-    Say thy prayers, and farewell.
shakes.txt-31351-  Fal. I would 'twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.
shakes.txt:31352:  Prince. Why, thou owest God a death.
shakes.txt-31353-Exit.
shakes.txt-31354-  Fal. 'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his day.
shakes.txt-31355-    What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well,

--
shakes.txt-31387-    Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
shakes.txt-31388-    Interpretation will misquote our looks,
shakes.txt-31389-    And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
shakes.txt:31390:    The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
shakes.txt-31391-    My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;  
shakes.txt-31392-    It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
shakes.txt-31393-    And an adopted name of privilege-

shakes.txt-31469-    If life did ride upon a dial's point,
shakes.txt-31470-    Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
shakes.txt-31471-    An if we live, we live to tread on kings;  
shakes.txt:31472:    If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
shakes.txt-31473-    Now for our consciences, the arms are fair,
shakes.txt-31474-    When the intent of bearing them is just.

shakes.txt-31512-    Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
shakes.txt-31513-  Blunt. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
shakes.txt-31514-    And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
shakes.txt:31515:    Lord Stafford's death.
shakes.txt-31516-
shakes.txt-31517-    They fight. Douglas kills Blunt. Then enter Hotspur.

shakes.txt-31551-  Prince. What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.
shakes.txt-31552-    Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
shakes.txt-31553-    Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
shakes.txt:31554:    Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithee
shakes.txt-31555-    Rend me thy sword.
shakes.txt-31556-  Fal. O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory
shakes.txt-31557-    never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid

shakes.txt-31642-    And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life,
shakes.txt-31643-    In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
shakes.txt-31644-  Prince. O God! they did me too much injury
shakes.txt:31645:    That ever said I heark'ned for your death.
shakes.txt-31646-    If it were so, I might have let alone
shakes.txt-31647-    The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
shakes.txt-31648-    Which would have been as speedy in your end

shakes.txt-31687-    But thoughts the slave, of life, and life time's fool,
shakes.txt-31688-    And time, that takes survey of all the world,
shakes.txt-31689-    Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
shakes.txt:31690:    But that the earthy and cold hand of death
shakes.txt-31691-    Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust,
shakes.txt-31692-    And food for-                                        [Dies.]
shakes.txt-31693-  Prince. For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart!
--

shakes.txt-31711-    I could have better spar'd a better man.
shakes.txt-31712-    O, I should have a heavy miss of thee
shakes.txt-31713-    If I were much in love with vanity!
shakes.txt:31714:    Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
shakes.txt-31715-    Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
shakes.txt-31716-    Embowell'd will I see thee by-and-by;
shakes.txt-31717-    Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                 Exit.

shakes.txt-31757-    rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury
shakes.txt-31758-    clock. If I may be believ'd, so; if not, let them that should
shakes.txt-31759-    reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it
shakes.txt:31760:    upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh. If the man  
shakes.txt-31761-    were alive and would deny it, zounds! I would make him eat a
shakes.txt-31762-    piece of my sword.
shakes.txt-31763-  John. This is the strangest tale that ever I beard.
--
--
shakes.txt-31797-  Wor. What I have done my safety urg'd me to;
shakes.txt-31798-    And I embrace this fortune patiently,
shakes.txt-31799-    Since not to be avoided it fails on me.
shakes.txt:31800:  King. Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too;
shakes.txt-31801-    Other offenders we will pause upon.  
shakes.txt-31802-                         Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, [guarded].
shakes.txt-31803-    How goes the field?

--
shakes.txt-31961-    To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
shakes.txt-31962-    Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
shakes.txt-31963-    And that the King before the Douglas' rage
shakes.txt:31964:    Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
shakes.txt-31965-    This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
shakes.txt-31966-    Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
shakes.txt-31967-    And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
--
--
shakes.txt-32015-    I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
shakes.txt-32016-  NORTHUMBERLAND. Good, an God will!
shakes.txt-32017-  LORD BARDOLPH. As good as heart can wish.
shakes.txt:32018:    The King is almost wounded to the death;
shakes.txt-32019-    And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
shakes.txt-32020-    Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
shakes.txt-32021-    Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John,
--
--
shakes.txt-32077-    Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
shakes.txt-32078-    Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
shakes.txt-32079-  MORTON. I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
shakes.txt:32080:    Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
shakes.txt-32081-    To fright our party.
shakes.txt-32082-  NORTHUMBERLAND. How doth my son and brother?
shakes.txt-32083-    Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek

shakes.txt-32087-    Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
shakes.txt-32088-    And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
shakes.txt-32089-    But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
shakes.txt:32090:    And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.  
shakes.txt-32091-    This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus;
shakes.txt-32092-    Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'-
shakes.txt-32093-    Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds;
--
--
shakes.txt-32110-    I see a strange confession in thine eye;  
shakes.txt-32111-    Thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin
shakes.txt-32112-    To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so:
shakes.txt:32113:    The tongue offends not that reports his death;
shakes.txt-32114-    And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
shakes.txt-32115-    Not he which says the dead is not alive.
shakes.txt-32116-    Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
--
--
shakes.txt-32125-    To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
shakes.txt-32126-    The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
shakes.txt-32127-    From whence with life he never more sprung up.
shakes.txt:32128:    In few, his death- whose spirit lent a fire
shakes.txt-32129-    Even to the dullest peasant in his camp-
shakes.txt-32130-    Being bruited once, took fire and heat away  
shakes.txt-32131-    From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;
--
--
shakes.txt-32431-    have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I
shakes.txt-32432-    am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name
shakes.txt-32433-    were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be
shakes.txt:32434:    eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
shakes.txt-32435-    perpetual motion.
shakes.txt-32436-  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your  
shakes.txt-32437-    expedition!
--
--
shakes.txt-32502-    Flatt'ring himself in project of a power
shakes.txt-32503-    Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
shakes.txt-32504-    And so, with great imagination
shakes.txt:32505:    Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
shakes.txt-32506-    And, winking, leapt into destruction.
shakes.txt-32507-  HASTINGS. But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
shakes.txt-32508-    To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.  
--

shakes.txt-33212-  BARDOLPH. Come, get you down stairs.
shakes.txt-33213-  PISTOL. What! shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue?
shakes.txt-33214-                                        [Snatching up his sword]
shakes.txt:33215:    Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!
shakes.txt-33216-    Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds
shakes.txt-33217-    Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!
shakes.txt-33218-  HOSTESS. Here's goodly stuff toward!

shakes.txt-33256-
shakes.txt-33257-       Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS disguised as drawers
shakes.txt-33258-
shakes.txt:33259:  FALSTAFF. Peace, good Doll! Do not speak like a death's-head; do
shakes.txt-33260-    not bid me remember mine end.
shakes.txt-33261-  DOLL. Sirrah, what humour's the Prince of?
shakes.txt-33262-  FALSTAFF. A good shallow young fellow. 'A would have made a good

shakes.txt-33454-    Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
shakes.txt-33455-    Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
shakes.txt-33456-    With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds,
shakes.txt:33457:    That with the hurly death itself awakes?
shakes.txt-33458-    Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
shakes.txt-33459-    To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;
shakes.txt-33460-    And in the calmest and most stillest night,
--
--
shakes.txt-33584-    days that I have spent! and to see how many of my old
shakes.txt-33585-    acquaintance are dead!
shakes.txt-33586-  SILENCE. We shall all follow, cousin.
shakes.txt:33587:  SHALLOW. Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure. Death, as the
shakes.txt-33588-    Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How a good yoke
shakes.txt-33589-    of bullocks at Stamford fair?
shakes.txt-33590-  SILENCE. By my troth, I was not there.
--

shakes.txt-33588-    Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall die. How a good yoke
shakes.txt-33589-    of bullocks at Stamford fair?
shakes.txt-33590-  SILENCE. By my troth, I was not there.
shakes.txt:33591:  SHALLOW. Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?
shakes.txt-33592-  SILENCE. Dead, sir.  
shakes.txt-33593-  SHALLOW. Jesu, Jesu, dead! drew a good bow; and dead! 'A shot a
shakes.txt-33594-    fine shoot. John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on

--
shakes.txt-33762-    forty, sir.
shakes.txt-33763-  BARDOLPH. Go to; stand aside.
shakes.txt-33764-  FEEBLE. By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God
shakes.txt:33765:    a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so;
shakes.txt-33766-    an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, let
shakes.txt-33767-    it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the
shakes.txt-33768-    next.
--
--
shakes.txt-34075-    And good from bad find no partition.
shakes.txt-34076-  ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
shakes.txt-34077-    Of dainty and such picking grievances;
shakes.txt:34078:    For he hath found to end one doubt by death
shakes.txt-34079-    Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
shakes.txt-34080-    And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
shakes.txt-34081-    And keep no tell-tale to his memory
--
--
shakes.txt-34131-    Your exposition on the holy text
shakes.txt-34132-    Than now to see you here an iron man,
shakes.txt-34133-    Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
shakes.txt:34134:    Turning the word to sword, and life to death.
shakes.txt-34135-    That man that sits within a monarch's heart
shakes.txt-34136-    And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
shakes.txt-34137-    Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
--
--
shakes.txt-34259-    Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.  
shakes.txt-34260-    Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt'red stray.
shakes.txt-34261-    God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.
shakes.txt:34262:    Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
shakes.txt-34263-    Treason's true bed and yielder-up of breath.          Exeunt
shakes.txt-34264-
shakes.txt-34265-

shakes.txt-34280-  COLVILLE. Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
shakes.txt-34281-  FALSTAFF. As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do you yield,
shakes.txt-34282-    sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops
shakes.txt:34283:    of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse up
shakes.txt-34284-    fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
shakes.txt-34285-  COLVILLE. I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought
shakes.txt-34286-    yield me.
--

shakes.txt-34465-  KING. Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;  
shakes.txt-34466-    And he, the noble image of my youth,
shakes.txt-34467-    Is overspread with them; therefore my grief
shakes.txt:34468:    Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.
shakes.txt-34469-    The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
shakes.txt-34470-    In forms imaginary, th'unguided days
shakes.txt-34471-    And rotten times that you shall look upon
--

shakes.txt-34628-  WARWICK. When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
shakes.txt-34629-  KING. The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out.
shakes.txt-34630-    Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
shakes.txt:34631:    My sleep my death?
shakes.txt-34632-    Find him, my lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
shakes.txt-34633-                                                    Exit WARWICK
shakes.txt-34634-    This part of his conjoins with my disease

shakes.txt-34677-    Is held from falling with so weak a wind
shakes.txt-34678-    That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.  
shakes.txt-34679-    Thou hast stol'n that which, after some few hours,
shakes.txt:34680:    Were thine without offense; and at my death
shakes.txt-34681-    Thou hast seal'd up my expectation.
shakes.txt-34682-    Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not,
shakes.txt-34683-    And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.
--
--
shakes.txt-34773-    Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears
shakes.txt-34774-    Thou seest with peril I have answered;
shakes.txt-34775-    For all my reign hath been but as a scene
shakes.txt:34776:    Acting that argument. And now my death
shakes.txt-34777-    Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd
shakes.txt-34778-    Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;  
shakes.txt-34779-    So thou the garland wear'st successively.
--

shakes.txt-35273-    Well, of sufferance comes ease.
shakes.txt-35274-  DOLL. Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.
shakes.txt-35275-  HOSTESS. Ay, come, you starv'd bloodhound.
shakes.txt:35276:  DOLL. Goodman death, goodman bones!
shakes.txt-35277-  HOSTESS. Thou atomy, thou!
shakes.txt-35278-  DOLL. Come, you thin thing! come, you rascal!
shakes.txt-35279-  FIRST BEADLE. Very well.                                Exeunt

shakes.txt-35355-    When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
shakes.txt-35356-    Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
shakes.txt-35357-    The tutor and the feeder of my riots.
shakes.txt:35358:    Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,
shakes.txt-35359-    As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
shakes.txt-35360-    Not to come near our person by ten mile.
shakes.txt-35361-    For competence of life I will allow you,

shakes.txt-36137-    would walk off I would prick your guts a little, in good terms,
shakes.txt-36138-    as I may, and thaes the humour of it.
shakes.txt-36139-  PISTOL. O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
shakes.txt:36140:    The grave doth gape and doting death is near;
shakes.txt-36141-    Therefore exhale.                             [PISTOL draws]  
shakes.txt-36142-  BARDOLPH. Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first
shakes.txt-36143-    stroke I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

shakes.txt-36228-  EXETER. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
shakes.txt-36229-    Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours-
shakes.txt-36230-    That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
shakes.txt:36231:    His sovereign's life to death and treachery!
shakes.txt-36232-
shakes.txt-36233-               Trumpets sound. Enter the KING, SCROOP,

shakes.txt-36374-    I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey,
shakes.txt-36375-      knight, of Northumberland.
shakes.txt-36376-  SCROOP. Our purposes God justly hath discover'd,
shakes.txt:36377:    And I repent my fault more than my death;  
shakes.txt-36378-    Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
shakes.txt-36379-    Although my body pay the price of it.
shakes.txt-36380-  CAMBRIDGE. For me, the gold of France did not seduce,

shakes.txt-36391-  KING HENRY. God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
shakes.txt-36392-    You have conspir'd against our royal person,
shakes.txt-36393-    Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his coffers
shakes.txt:36394:    Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death;
shakes.txt-36395-    Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
shakes.txt-36396-    His princes and his peers to servitude,
shakes.txt-36397-    His subjects to oppression and contempt,  
--
--
shakes.txt-36400-    But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
shakes.txt-36401-    Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
shakes.txt-36402-    We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
shakes.txt:36403:    Poor miserable wretches, to your death;
shakes.txt-36404-    The taste whereof God of his mercy give
shakes.txt-36405-    You patience to endure, and true repentance
shakes.txt-36406-    Of all your dear offences. Bear them hence.

shakes.txt-37167-  PISTOL. Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
shakes.txt-37168-    For he hath stol'n a pax, and hanged must 'a be-
shakes.txt:37169:    A damned death!
shakes.txt-37170-    Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free,
shakes.txt-37171-    And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.

shakes.txt-37170-    Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free,
shakes.txt-37171-    And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.
shakes.txt:37172:    But Exeter hath given the doom of death
shakes.txt-37173-    For pax of little price.
shakes.txt-37174-    Therefore, go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice;

shakes.txt-37684-    master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so:
shakes.txt-37685-    the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his  
shakes.txt-37686-    soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant;
shakes.txt:37687:    for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
shakes.txt-37688-    services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so
shakes.txt-37689-    spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out

shakes.txt-37697-    vengeance; so that here men are punish'd for before-breach of the
shakes.txt-37698-    King's laws in now the King's quarrel. Where they feared the
shakes.txt:37699:    death they have borne life away; and where they would be safe
shakes.txt-37700-    they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King
shakes.txt-37701-    guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those

--
shakes.txt-37703-    duty is the King's; but every subject's soul is his own.
shakes.txt-37704-    Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man
shakes.txt-37705-    in his bed- wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so,  
shakes.txt:37706:    death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly

shakes.txt-37908-    To demonstrate the life of such a battle
shakes.txt-37909-    In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
shakes.txt:37910:  CONSTABLE. They have said their prayers and they stay for death.
shakes.txt-37911-  DAUPHIN. Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,
shakes.txt-37912-    And give their fasting horses provender,
shakes.txt-37913-    And after fight with them?

shakes.txt-38219-    So did he turn, and over Suffolk's neck
shakes.txt-38220-    He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
shakes.txt:38221:    And so, espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
shakes.txt-38222-    A testament of noble-ending love.

shakes.txt:38536:    Here was a royal fellowship of death!
shakes.txt-38537-    Where is the number of our English dead?
shakes.txt-38538-                                 [HERALD presents another paper]
shakes.txt-38539-    Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,

shakes.txt-38548-    For it is none but thine.
shakes.txt-38549-  EXETER. 'Tis wonderful!
shakes.txt-38550-  KING HENRY. Come, go we in procession to the village;
shakes.txt:38551:    And be it death proclaimed through our host
shakes.txt-38552-    To boast of this or take that praise from God
shakes.txt-38553-    Which is his only.
shakes.txt-38554-  FLUELLEN. Is it not lawful, an please your Majesty, to tell how

shakes.txt-39202-    night! Comets, importing change of times and states,
shakes.txt-39203-    Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
shakes.txt-39204-    And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
shakes.txt:39205:    That have consented unto Henry's death!
shakes.txt-39206-    King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
shakes.txt-39207-    England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
shakes.txt-39208-  GLOUCESTER. England ne'er had a king until his time.
--
--
shakes.txt-39217-  EXETER. We mourn in black; why mourn we not in blood?
shakes.txt-39218-    Henry is dead and never shall revive.
shakes.txt-39219-    Upon a wooden coffin we attend;
shakes.txt:39220:    And death's dishonourable victory
shakes.txt-39221-    We with our stately presence glorify,
shakes.txt-39222-    Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
shakes.txt-39223-    What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
--
--
shakes.txt-39266-    Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
shakes.txt-39267-  BEDFORD. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
shakes.txt-39268-    Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
shakes.txt:39269:    Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
shakes.txt-39270-  GLOUCESTER. Is Paris lost? Is Rouen yielded up?  
shakes.txt-39271-    If Henry were recall'd to life again,
shakes.txt-39272-    These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
--

shakes.txt-39421-    Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
shakes.txt-39422-  CHARLES. Sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.
shakes.txt-39423-    Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
shakes.txt:39424:    Him I forgive my death that killeth me,

shakes.txt-39552-    Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
shakes.txt-39553-    Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
shakes.txt:39554:    With Henry's death the English circle ends;
shakes.txt-39555-    Dispersed are the glories it included.
shakes.txt-39556-    Now am I like that proud insulting ship
shakes.txt-39557-    Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.

shakes.txt-39580-  GLOUCESTER. I am come to survey the Tower this day;
shakes.txt:39581:    Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
shakes.txt-39582-    Where be these warders that they wait not here?
shakes.txt-39583-    Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.

shakes.txt:39680:    pain of death.
shakes.txt-39681-  GLOUCESTER. Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law;

shakes.txt-39683-  WINCHESTER. Gloucester, we'll meet to thy cost, be sure;

shakes.txt-39742-    For him was I exchang'd and ransomed.
shakes.txt-39743-    But with a baser man of arms by far
shakes.txt-39744-    Once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;
shakes.txt:39745:    Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
shakes.txt-39746-    Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
shakes.txt-39747-    In fine, redeem'd I was as I desir'd.
shakes.txt-39748-    But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
--

shakes.txt-39758-    And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
shakes.txt-39759-    To hurl at the beholders of my shame;
shakes.txt-39760-    My grisly countenance made others fly;
shakes.txt:39761:    None durst come near for fear of sudden death.  
shakes.txt-39762-    In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
shakes.txt-39763-    So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
shakes.txt-39764-    That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
--

shakes.txt-39887-    As you fly from your oft subdued slaves.
shakes.txt-39888-                                 [Alarum. Here another skirmish]
shakes.txt-39889-    It will not be-retire into your trenches.
shakes.txt:39890:    You all consented unto Salisbury's death,
shakes.txt-39891-    For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
shakes.txt-39892-    Pucelle is ent'red into Orleans
shakes.txt-39893-    In spite of us or aught that we could do.

shakes.txt-40089-    A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
shakes.txt-40090-    Upon the which, that every one may read,  
shakes.txt-40091-    Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans,
shakes.txt:40092:    The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
shakes.txt-40093-    And what a terror he had been to France.
shakes.txt-40094-    But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
shakes.txt-40095-    I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,

--
shakes.txt-40152-  PORTER. Madam, I will.
shakes.txt-40153-  COUNTESS. The plot is laid; if all things fall out right,
shakes.txt-40154-    I shall as famous be by this exploit.
shakes.txt:40155:    As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
shakes.txt-40156-    Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,
shakes.txt-40157-    And his achievements of no less account.
shakes.txt-40158-    Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears

shakes.txt-40387-    And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
shakes.txt-40388-    Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,
shakes.txt-40389-    Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
shakes.txt:40390:    A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
shakes.txt-40391-  PLANTAGENET. Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you  
shakes.txt-40392-    That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
shakes.txt-40393-  VERNON. In your behalf still will I wear the same.
--
--
shakes.txt-40409-    Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
shakes.txt-40410-    Even like a man new haled from the rack,
shakes.txt-40411-    So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
shakes.txt:40412:    And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
shakes.txt-40413-    Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
shakes.txt-40414-    Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
shakes.txt-40415-    These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
--

shakes.txt-40433-    And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,
shakes.txt-40434-    Depriv'd of honour and inheritance.
shakes.txt-40435-    But now the arbitrator of despairs,
shakes.txt:40436:    Just Death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
shakes.txt-40437-    With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.
shakes.txt-40438-    I would his troubles likewise were expir'd,
shakes.txt-40439-    That so he might recover what was lost.
--
--
shakes.txt-40455-    This day, in argument upon a case,
shakes.txt-40456-    Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
shakes.txt-40457-    Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
shakes.txt:40458:    And did upbraid me with my father's death;
shakes.txt-40459-    Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
shakes.txt-40460-    Else with the like I had requited him.
shakes.txt-40461-    Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
--
--
shakes.txt-40469-  PLANTAGENET. Discover more at large what cause that was,
shakes.txt-40470-    For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
shakes.txt-40471-  MORTIMER. I will, if that my fading breath permit
shakes.txt:40472:    And death approach not ere my tale be done.
shakes.txt-40473-    Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
shakes.txt-40474-    Depos'd his nephew Richard, Edward's son,

shakes.txt-40502-    In whom the title rested, were suppress'd.
shakes.txt-40503-  PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last.  
shakes.txt-40504-  MORTIMER. True; and thou seest that I no issue have,
shakes.txt:40505:    And that my fainting words do warrant death.
shakes.txt-40506-    Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;
shakes.txt-40507-    But yet be wary in thy studious care.
shakes.txt-40508-  PLANTAGENET. Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
--
--
shakes.txt-40750-    That doth belong unto the house of York,
shakes.txt-40751-    From whence you spring by lineal descent.
shakes.txt-40752-  PLANTAGENET. Thy humble servant vows obedience
shakes.txt:40753:    And humble service till the point of death.
shakes.txt-40754-  KING HENRY. Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
shakes.txt-40755-    And in reguerdon of that duty done
shakes.txt-40756-    I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.  
--
--
shakes.txt-40868-  BEDFORD. O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
shakes.txt-40869-  PUCELLE. What you do, good grey beard? Break a
shakes.txt-40870-    lance,
shakes.txt:40871:    And run a tilt at death within a chair?
shakes.txt-40872-  TALBOT. Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite,
shakes.txt-40873-    Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours,
shakes.txt-40874-    Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
--
--
shakes.txt-41040-    And see the cities and the towns defac'd
shakes.txt-41041-    By wasting ruin of the cruel foe;
shakes.txt-41042-    As looks the mother on her lowly babe
shakes.txt:41043:    When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
shakes.txt-41044-    See, see the pining malady of France;
shakes.txt-41045-    Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
shakes.txt-41046-    Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.
--
--
shakes.txt-41139-  VERNON. Hark ye: not so. In witness, take ye that.
shakes.txt-41140-                                                   [Strikes him]
shakes.txt-41141-  BASSET. Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such
shakes.txt:41142:    That whoso draws a sword 'tis present death,
shakes.txt-41143-    Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
shakes.txt-41144-    But I'll unto his Majesty and crave
shakes.txt-41145-    I may have liberty to venge this wrong;

--
shakes.txt-41209-    Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,
shakes.txt-41210-    Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
shakes.txt-41211-    Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
shakes.txt:41212:    Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,
shakes.txt-41213-    But always resolute in most extremes.
shakes.txt-41214-    He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
shakes.txt-41215-    Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,

--
shakes.txt-41220-  KING HENRY. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy
shakes.txt-41221-    doom.
shakes.txt-41222-    Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight;
shakes.txt:41223:    Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.
shakes.txt-41224-                                                   Exit FASTOLFE  
shakes.txt-41225-    And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter
shakes.txt-41226-    Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.

--
shakes.txt-41408-    Shall lay your stately and air braving towers,
shakes.txt-41409-    If you forsake the offer of their love.
shakes.txt-41410-  GENERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of
shakes.txt:41411:    death,
shakes.txt-41412-    Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
shakes.txt-41413-    The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
--
shakes.txt-41412-    Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
shakes.txt-41413-    The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
shakes.txt:41414:    On us thou canst not enter but by death;
shakes.txt-41415-    For, I protest, we are well fortified,
shakes.txt-41416-    And strong enough to issue out and fight.
shakes.txt-41417-    If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
--
--
shakes.txt-41419-    On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
shakes.txt-41420-    To wall thee from the liberty of flight,
shakes.txt-41421-    And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
shakes.txt:41422:    But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
shakes.txt-41423-    And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
shakes.txt-41424-    Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
shakes.txt-41425-    To rive their dangerous artillery
--
--
shakes.txt-41507-  YORK. Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
shakes.txt-41508-    To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
shakes.txt-41509-    Away! vexation almost stops my breath,
shakes.txt:41510:    That sund'red friends greet in the hour of death.
shakes.txt-41511-    Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can
shakes.txt-41512-    But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
shakes.txt-41513-    Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away
--
--
shakes.txt-41549-    Talbot,
shakes.txt-41550-    Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,
shakes.txt-41551-    Cries out for noble York and Somerset
shakes.txt:41552:    To beat assailing death from his weak legions;
shakes.txt-41553-    And whiles the honourable captain there
shakes.txt-41554-    Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
shakes.txt-41555-    And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
--
--
shakes.txt-41594-    When sapless age and weak unable limbs
shakes.txt-41595-    Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
shakes.txt-41596-    But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
shakes.txt:41597:    Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
shakes.txt-41598-    A terrible and unavoided danger;
shakes.txt-41599-    Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
shakes.txt-41600-    And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
--
--
shakes.txt-41605-    To make a bastard and a slave of me!
shakes.txt-41606-    The world will say he is not Talbot's blood  
shakes.txt-41607-    That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
shakes.txt:41608:  TALBOT. Fly to revenge my death, if I be slain.
shakes.txt-41609-  JOHN. He that flies so will ne'er return again.
shakes.txt-41610-  TALBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
shakes.txt-41611-  JOHN. Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.
--
--
shakes.txt-41611-  JOHN. Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.
shakes.txt-41612-    Your loss is great, so your regard should be;
shakes.txt-41613-    My worth unknown, no loss is known in me;
shakes.txt:41614:    Upon my death the French can little boast;
shakes.txt-41615-    In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
shakes.txt-41616-    Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
shakes.txt-41617-    But mine it will, that no exploit have done;
--
--
shakes.txt-41631-  JOHN. Yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?
shakes.txt-41632-  TALBOT. Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
shakes.txt-41633-  JOHN. You cannot witness for me, being slain.
shakes.txt:41634:    If death be so apparent, then both fly.
shakes.txt-41635-  TALBOT. And leave my followers here to fight and die?
shakes.txt-41636-    My age was never tainted with such shame.
shakes.txt-41637-  JOHN. And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
--
--
shakes.txt-41658-    The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word
shakes.txt-41659-    And left us to the rage of France his sword.
shakes.txt-41660-    Where is John Talbot? Pause and take thy breath;
shakes.txt:41661:    I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death.
shakes.txt-41662-  JOHN. O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
shakes.txt-41663-    The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done
shakes.txt-41664-    Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate,

--
shakes.txt-41684-    Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
shakes.txt-41685-    Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
shakes.txt-41686-    Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
shakes.txt:41687:    Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
shakes.txt-41688-    The help of one stands me in little stead.
shakes.txt-41689-    O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
shakes.txt-41690-    To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
--
--
shakes.txt-41693-    By me they nothing gain an if I stay:
shakes.txt-41694-    'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
shakes.txt-41695-    In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
shakes.txt:41696:    My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame.
shakes.txt-41697-    All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
shakes.txt-41698-    All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away.
shakes.txt-41699-  JOHN. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
--
--
shakes.txt-41724-
shakes.txt-41725-  TALBOT. Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.
shakes.txt-41726-    O, where's young Talbot? Where is valiant John?
shakes.txt:41727:    Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
shakes.txt-41728-    Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee.
shakes.txt-41729-    When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee,
shakes.txt-41730-    His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
--
--
shakes.txt-41742-         Enter soldiers, bearing the body of JOHN TALBOT
shakes.txt-41743-
shakes.txt-41744-  SERVANT. O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!
shakes.txt:41745:  TALBOT. Thou antic Death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
shakes.txt-41746-    Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
shakes.txt-41747-    Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
shakes.txt-41748-    Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
--
--
shakes.txt-41747-    Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
shakes.txt-41748-    Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
shakes.txt-41749-    In thy despite shall scape mortality.
shakes.txt:41750:    O thou whose wounds become hard-favoured Death,
shakes.txt-41751-    Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
--
shakes.txt-41751-    Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
shakes.txt:41752:    Brave Death by speaking, whether he will or no;
shakes.txt-41753-    Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
shakes.txt-41754-    Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
--
shakes.txt-41753-    Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
shakes.txt-41754-    Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
shakes.txt:41755:    Had Death been French, then Death had died to-day.
shakes.txt-41756-    Come, come, and lay him in his father's arms.
shakes.txt-41757-    My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
shakes.txt-41758-    Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
--
--
shakes.txt-42215-  SHEPHERD. Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
shakes.txt-42216-    Have I sought every country far and near,
shakes.txt-42217-    And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
shakes.txt:42218:    Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
shakes.txt-42219-    Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
shakes.txt-42220-  PUCELLE. Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
shakes.txt-42221-    I am descended of a gentler blood;
--
--
shakes.txt-42226-    She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.
shakes.txt-42227-  WARWICK. Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?  
shakes.txt-42228-  YORK. This argues what her kind of life hath been-
shakes.txt:42229:    Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
shakes.txt-42230-  SHEPHERD. Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
shakes.txt-42231-    God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
shakes.txt-42232-    And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
--
--
shakes.txt-42274-    That warranteth by law to be thy privilege:
shakes.txt-42275-    I am with child, ye bloody homicides;
shakes.txt-42276-    Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
shakes.txt:42277:    Although ye hale me to a violent death.
shakes.txt-42278-  YORK. Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!
shakes.txt-42279-  WARWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
shakes.txt-42280-    Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
--
--
shakes.txt-42300-    curse:
shakes.txt-42301-    May never glorious sun reflex his beams
shakes.txt-42302-    Upon the country where you make abode;
shakes.txt:42303:    But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
shakes.txt-42304-    Environ you, till mischief and despair
shakes.txt-42305-    Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
shakes.txt-42306-                                                   Exit, guarded
--
--
shakes.txt-42727-    Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
shakes.txt-42728-    Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
shakes.txt-42729-    Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
shakes.txt:42730:  SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
shakes.txt-42731-    These counties were the keys of Normandy!
shakes.txt-42732-    But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?  
shakes.txt-42733-  WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery;
--
--
shakes.txt-43287-  SPIRIT. Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
shakes.txt-43288-  BOLINGBROKE. [Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'  
shakes.txt-43289-  SPIRIT. The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
shakes.txt:43290:    But him outlive, and die a violent death.
shakes.txt-43291-             [As the SPIRIT speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]
shakes.txt-43292-  BOLINGBROKE. 'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
shakes.txt-43293-  SPIRIT. By water shall he die and take his end.
--
--
shakes.txt-43323-    Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
shakes.txt-43324-    What have we here?                                   [Reads]
shakes.txt-43325-    'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
shakes.txt:43326:    But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
shakes.txt-43327-    Why, this is just
shakes.txt-43328-    'Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse.'  
shakes.txt-43329-    Well, to the rest:
--
--
shakes.txt-43571-    Dealing with witches and with conjurers,
shakes.txt-43572-    Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
shakes.txt-43573-    Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
shakes.txt:43574:    Demanding of King Henry's life and death
shakes.txt-43575-    And other of your Highness' Privy Council,
shakes.txt-43576-    As more at large your Grace shall understand.
shakes.txt-43577-  CARDINAL. And so, my Lord Protector, by this means
--
--
shakes.txt-43631-    William of Windsor was the seventh and last.  
shakes.txt-43632-    Edward the Black Prince died before his father
shakes.txt-43633-    And left behind him Richard, his only son,
shakes.txt:43634:    Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king
shakes.txt-43635-    Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
shakes.txt-43636-    The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
shakes.txt-43637-    Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
--
--
shakes.txt-43688-    Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock,
shakes.txt-43689-    That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey;
shakes.txt-43690-    'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
shakes.txt:43691:    Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.  
shakes.txt-43692-  SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
shakes.txt-43693-  WARWICK. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
shakes.txt-43694-    Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
--
--
shakes.txt-43709-  KING HENRY. Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
shakes.txt-43710-    In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;
shakes.txt-43711-    Receive the sentence of the law for sins
shakes.txt:43712:    Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death.
shakes.txt-43713-    You four, from hence to prison back again;
shakes.txt-43714-    From thence unto the place of execution:
shakes.txt-43715-    The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,
--
--
shakes.txt-43719-    Shall, after three days' open penance done,
shakes.txt-43720-    Live in your country here in banishment
shakes.txt-43721-    With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.  
shakes.txt:43722:  DUCHESS. Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
shakes.txt-43723-  GLOUCESTER. Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee.
shakes.txt-43724-    I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
shakes.txt-43725-             Exeunt the DUCHESS and the other prisoners, guarded
--
--
shakes.txt-43797-  SALISBURY. Thump? Then see thou thump thy master well.
shakes.txt-43798-  HORNER. Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
shakes.txt-43799-    instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and
shakes.txt:43800:    touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him
shakes.txt-43801-    any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have  
shakes.txt-43802-    at thee with a down right blow!
shakes.txt-43803-  YORK. Dispatch- this knave's tongue begins to double.
--
--
shakes.txt-43810-  PETER. O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O
shakes.txt-43811-    Peter, thou hast prevail'd in right!
shakes.txt-43812-  KING HENRY. Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
shakes.txt:43813:    For by his death we do perceive his guilt;
shakes.txt-43814-    And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
shakes.txt-43815-    The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
shakes.txt-43816-    Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
--
--
shakes.txt-43879-    Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
shakes.txt-43880-    To every idle rascal follower.
shakes.txt-43881-    But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,
shakes.txt:43882:    Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
shakes.txt-43883-    Hang over thee, as sure it shortly will.
shakes.txt-43884-    For Suffolk- he that can do all in all  
shakes.txt-43885-    With her that hateth thee and hates us all-
--
--
shakes.txt-43922-  GLOUCESTER. Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
shakes.txt-43923-                                  Exeunt GLOUCESTER and servants
shakes.txt-43924-  DUCHESS. Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee!  
shakes.txt:43925:    For none abides with me. My joy is death-
shakes.txt:43926:    Death, at whose name I oft have been afeard,
shakes.txt-43927-    Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
shakes.txt-43928-    Stanley, I prithee go, and take me hence;
shakes.txt-43929-    I care not whither, for I beg no favour,
--
--
shakes.txt-44024-    No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man  
shakes.txt-44025-    Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.
shakes.txt-44026-  CARDINAL. Did he not, contrary to form of law,
shakes.txt:44027:    Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
shakes.txt-44028-  YORK. And did he not, in his protectorship,
shakes.txt-44029-    Levy great sums of money through the realm
shakes.txt-44030-    For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
--
--
shakes.txt-44119-    Foul subornation is predominant,
shakes.txt-44120-    And equity exil'd your Highness' land.
shakes.txt-44121-    I know their complot is to have my life;
shakes.txt:44122:    And if my death might make this island happy
shakes.txt-44123-    And prove the period of their tyranny,
shakes.txt-44124-    I would expend it with all willingness.  
shakes.txt-44125-    But mine is made the prologue to their play;
--
--
shakes.txt-44207-    This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
shakes.txt-44208-    To rid us from the fear we have of him.
shakes.txt-44209-  CARDINAL. That he should die is worthy policy;
shakes.txt:44210:    But yet we want a colour for his death.
shakes.txt-44211-    'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
shakes.txt-44212-  SUFFOLK. But, in my mind, that were no policy:
shakes.txt-44213-    The King will labour still to save his life;
--
--
shakes.txt-44213-    The King will labour still to save his life;
shakes.txt-44214-    The commons haply rise to save his life;
shakes.txt-44215-    And yet we have but trivial argument,
shakes.txt:44216:    More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
shakes.txt-44217-  YORK. So that, by this, you would not have him die.
shakes.txt-44218-  SUFFOLK. Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
--
shakes.txt-44217-  YORK. So that, by this, you would not have him die.
shakes.txt-44218-  SUFFOLK. Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
shakes.txt:44219:  YORK. 'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
shakes.txt-44220-    But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
shakes.txt-44221-    Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:
shakes.txt-44222-    Were't not all one an empty eagle were set
--
--
shakes.txt-44222-    Were't not all one an empty eagle were set
shakes.txt-44223-    To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
shakes.txt-44224-    As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector?  
shakes.txt:44225:  QUEEN. So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
shakes.txt-44226-  SUFFOLK. Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness then
shakes.txt-44227-    To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
shakes.txt-44228-    Who being accus'd a crafty murderer,
--
--
shakes.txt-44309-  YORK. Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts
shakes.txt-44310-    And change misdoubt to resolution;
shakes.txt-44311-    Be that thou hop'st to be; or what thou art
shakes.txt:44312:    Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying.
shakes.txt-44313-    Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man
shakes.txt-44314-    And find no harbour in a royal heart.
shakes.txt-44315-    Faster than spring-time show'rs comes thought on thought,
--
--
shakes.txt-44434-    Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding;
shakes.txt-44435-    Yet do not go away; come, basilisk,
shakes.txt-44436-    And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
shakes.txt:44437:    For in the shade of death I shall find joy-
shakes.txt:44438:    In life but double death,'now Gloucester's dead.
shakes.txt-44439-  QUEEN. Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
shakes.txt-44440-    Although the Duke was enemy to him,
--
shakes.txt-44439-  QUEEN. Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
shakes.txt-44440-    Although the Duke was enemy to him,
shakes.txt:44441:    Yet he most Christian-like laments his death;
shakes.txt-44442-    And for myself- foe as he was to me-
shakes.txt-44443-    Might liquid tears, or heart-offending groans,
shakes.txt-44444-    Or blood-consuming sighs, recall his life,
--
--
shakes.txt-44450-    It may be judg'd I made the Duke away;
shakes.txt-44451-    So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
shakes.txt-44452-    And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
shakes.txt:44453:    This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy!
shakes.txt-44454-    To be a queen and crown'd with infamy!
shakes.txt-44455-  KING HENRY. Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
shakes.txt-44456-  QUEEN. Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
--
--
shakes.txt-44513-    That want their leader, scatter up and down
shakes.txt-44514-    And care not who they sting in his revenge.
shakes.txt-44515-    Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
shakes.txt:44516:    Until they hear the order of his death.
shakes.txt-44517-  KING HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
shakes.txt-44518-    But how he died God knows, not Henry.
shakes.txt-44519-    Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
--
--
shakes.txt-44517-  KING HENRY. That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
shakes.txt-44518-    But how he died God knows, not Henry.
shakes.txt-44519-    Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
shakes.txt:44520:    And comment then upon his sudden death.
shakes.txt-44521-  WARWICK. That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
shakes.txt-44522-    With the rude multitude till I return.                  Exit
shakes.txt-44523-                                   Exit SALISBURY with the commons
--
--
shakes.txt-44540-  WARWICK. Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
shakes.txt-44541-  KING HENRY. That is to see how deep my grave is made;
shakes.txt-44542-    For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
shakes.txt:44543:    For, seeing him, I see my life in death.
shakes.txt-44544-  WARWICK. As surely as my soul intends to live
shakes.txt-44545-    With that dread King that took our state upon Him
shakes.txt-44546-    To free us from his Father's wrathful curse,
--
--
shakes.txt-44552-    Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
shakes.txt-44553-    Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,
shakes.txt-44554-    Being all descended to the labouring heart,
shakes.txt:44555:    Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
shakes.txt-44556-    Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,
shakes.txt-44557-    Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth
shakes.txt-44558-    To blush and beautify the cheek again.
--
--
shakes.txt-44567-    Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.  
shakes.txt-44568-    It cannot be but he was murd'red here:
shakes.txt-44569-    The least of all these signs were probable.
shakes.txt:44570:  SUFFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?
shakes.txt-44571-    Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
shakes.txt-44572-    And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
shakes.txt-44573-  WARWICK. But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes;
--
--
shakes.txt-44575-    'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
shakes.txt-44576-    And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
shakes.txt-44577-  QUEEN. Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
shakes.txt:44578:    As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
shakes.txt-44579-  WARWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,
shakes.txt-44580-    And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
shakes.txt-44581-    But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
--
--
shakes.txt-44590-    That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
shakes.txt-44591-    That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
shakes.txt-44592-    Say if thou dar'st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
shakes.txt:44593:    That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
shakes.txt-44594-                           Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others
shakes.txt-44595-  WARWICK. What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
shakes.txt-44596-  QUEEN. He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,
--
--
shakes.txt-44606-    Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,
shakes.txt-44607-    And never of the Nevils' noble race.  
shakes.txt-44608-  WARWICK. But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,
shakes.txt:44609:    And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
shakes.txt-44610-    Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
shakes.txt-44611-    And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
shakes.txt-44612-    I would, false murd'rous coward, on thy knee
--
--
shakes.txt-44642-  SALISBURY. [To the Commons within] Sirs, stand apart, the King
shakes.txt-44643-      shall know your mind.
shakes.txt-44644-    Dread lord, the commons send you word by me
shakes.txt:44645:    Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
shakes.txt-44646-    Or banished fair England's territories,
shakes.txt-44647-    They will by violence tear him from your palace  
--
shakes.txt-44646-    Or banished fair England's territories,
shakes.txt-44647-    They will by violence tear him from your palace  
shakes.txt:44648:    And torture him with grievous ling'ring death.
shakes.txt-44649-    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
--
shakes.txt-44649-    They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
shakes.txt:44650:    They say in him they fear your Highness' death;
shakes.txt-44651-    And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
shakes.txt-44652-    Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
shakes.txt-44653-    As being thought to contradict your liking,
--
--
shakes.txt-44655-    They say, in care of your most royal person,
shakes.txt-44656-    That if your Highness should intend to sleep
shakes.txt-44657-    And charge that no man should disturb your rest,
shakes.txt:44658:    In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
shakes.txt-44659-    Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
shakes.txt-44660-    Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
shakes.txt-44661-    That slily glided towards your Majesty,

shakes.txt-44686-    And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
shakes.txt-44687-    Whose far unworthy deputy I am,  
shakes.txt-44688-    He shall not breathe infection in this air
shakes.txt:44689:    But three days longer, on the pain of death.
shakes.txt-44690-                                                  Exit SALISBURY
shakes.txt-44691-  QUEEN. O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
shakes.txt-44692-  KING HENRY. Ungentle Queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
--
--
shakes.txt-44772-
shakes.txt-44773-  QUEEN. Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?
shakes.txt-44774-  VAUX. To signify unto his Majesty
shakes.txt:44775:    That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
shakes.txt-44776-    For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
shakes.txt-44777-    That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air,
shakes.txt-44778-    Blaspheming God, and cursing men on earth.
--
--
shakes.txt-44804-    Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
shakes.txt-44805-    And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
shakes.txt-44806-    To die by thee were but to die in jest:
shakes.txt:44807:    From thee to die were torture more than death.  
shakes.txt-44808-    O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
shakes.txt-44809-  QUEEN. Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,
--
shakes.txt-44808-    O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
shakes.txt-44809-  QUEEN. Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,
shakes.txt:44810:    It is applied to a deathful wound.
shakes.txt-44811-    To France, sweet Suffolk. Let me hear from thee;
shakes.txt-44812-    For whereso'er thou art in this world's globe
shakes.txt-44813-    I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
--
--
shakes.txt-44816-  SUFFOLK. A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask
shakes.txt-44817-    That ever did contain a thing of worth.
shakes.txt-44818-    Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we:
shakes.txt:44819:    This way fall I to death.
shakes.txt-44820-  QUEEN. This way for me.                       Exeunt severally
shakes.txt-44821-
shakes.txt-44822-
--
--
shakes.txt-44828-Enter the KING, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed
shakes.txt-44829-
shakes.txt-44830-  KING HENRY. How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.
shakes.txt:44831:  CARDINAL. If thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure,
shakes.txt-44832-    Enough to purchase such another island,
shakes.txt-44833-    So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain.
shakes.txt-44834-  KING HENRY. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life
--
--
shakes.txt-44832-    Enough to purchase such another island,
shakes.txt-44833-    So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain.
shakes.txt-44834-  KING HENRY. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life
shakes.txt:44835:    Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
shakes.txt-44836-  WARWICK. Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
shakes.txt-44837-  CARDINAL. Bring me unto my trial when you will.
shakes.txt-44838-    Died he not in his bed? Where should he die?
--
--
shakes.txt-44850-    O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
shakes.txt-44851-    That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul,
shakes.txt-44852-    And from his bosom purge this black despair!
shakes.txt:44853:  WARWICK. See how the pangs of death do make him grin
shakes.txt-44854-  SALISBURY. Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
shakes.txt-44855-  KING HENRY. Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
shakes.txt-44856-    Lord Card'nal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
--
--
shakes.txt-44856-    Lord Card'nal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
shakes.txt-44857-    Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
shakes.txt-44858-    He dies, and makes no sign: O God, forgive him!
shakes.txt:44859:  WARWICK. So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
shakes.txt-44860-  KING HENRY. Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
shakes.txt-44861-    Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;
shakes.txt-44862-    And let us all to meditation.                         Exeunt
--
--
shakes.txt-44913-  SUFFOLK. Look on my George, I am a gentleman:
shakes.txt-44914-    Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
shakes.txt-44915-  WHITMORE. And so am I: my name is Walter Whitmore.
shakes.txt:44916:    How now! Why start'st thou? What, doth death affright?
shakes.txt:44917:  SUFFOLK. Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
shakes.txt-44918-    A cunning man did calculate my birth  
shakes.txt-44919-    And told me that by water I should die;
shakes.txt-44920-    Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
--
--
shakes.txt-44959-    Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
shakes.txt-44960-    For swallowing the treasure of the realm.
shakes.txt-44961-    Thy lips, that kiss'd the Queen, shall sweep the ground;
shakes.txt:44962:    And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
shakes.txt-44963-    Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
shakes.txt-44964-    Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again;
shakes.txt-44965-    And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
--
--
shakes.txt-44999-    I go of message from the Queen to France:
shakes.txt-45000-    I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
shakes.txt-45001-  LIEUTENANT. Walter-
shakes.txt:45002:  WHITMORE. Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
shakes.txt-45003-  SUFFOLK. Gelidus timor occupat artus: it is thee I fear.
shakes.txt-45004-  WHITMORE. Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
shakes.txt-45005-    What, are ye daunted now? Now will ye stoop?
--
--
shakes.txt-45016-    More can I bear than you dare execute.
shakes.txt-45017-  LIEUTENANT. Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
shakes.txt-45018-  SUFFOLK. Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,  
shakes.txt:45019:    That this my death may never be forgot-
shakes.txt-45020-    Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
shakes.txt-45021-    A Roman sworder and banditto slave
shakes.txt-45022-    Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
--
--
shakes.txt-45286-  KING HENRY. Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
shakes.txt-45287-  SAY. Ay, but I hope your Highness shall have his.
shakes.txt-45288-  KING HENRY. How now, madam!
shakes.txt:45289:    Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
shakes.txt-45290-    I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
shakes.txt-45291-    Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.
shakes.txt-45292-  QUEEN. No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.
--
--
shakes.txt-45301-    And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
shakes.txt-45302-    His army is a ragged multitude  
shakes.txt-45303-    Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless;
shakes.txt:45304:    Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death
shakes.txt-45305-    Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.
shakes.txt-45306-    All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
--
shakes.txt-45305-    Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.
shakes.txt-45306-    All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
shakes.txt:45307:    They call false caterpillars and intend their death.
shakes.txt-45308-  KING HENRY. O graceless men! they know not what they do.
shakes.txt-45309-  BUCKINGHAM. My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth
shakes.txt-45310-    Until a power be rais'd to put them down.
--
--
shakes.txt-45480-    Have I affected wealth or honour? Speak.
shakes.txt-45481-    Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
shakes.txt-45482-    Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
shakes.txt:45483:    Whom have I injur'd, that ye seek my death?
shakes.txt-45484-    These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,
shakes.txt-45485-    This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.
shakes.txt-45486-    O, let me live!
--
--
shakes.txt-45540-    That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
shakes.txt-45541-  CLIFFORD. What say ye, countrymen? Will ye relent
shakes.txt-45542-    And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you,
shakes.txt:45543:    Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
shakes.txt-45544-    Who loves the King, and will embrace his pardon,  
shakes.txt-45545-    Fling up his cap and say 'God save his Majesty!'
shakes.txt-45546-    Who hateth him and honours not his father,
--
--
shakes.txt-45620-
shakes.txt-45621-  CLIFFORD. He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield,  
shakes.txt-45622-    And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
shakes.txt:45623:    Expect your Highness' doom of life or death.
shakes.txt-45624-  KING HENRY. Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,
shakes.txt-45625-    To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
shakes.txt-45626-    Soldiers, this day have you redeem'd your lives,
--
--
shakes.txt-45654-    Until his army be dismiss'd from him.
shakes.txt-45655-  SOMERSET. My lord,
shakes.txt-45656-    I'll yield myself to prison willingly,
shakes.txt:45657:    Or unto death, to do my country good.
shakes.txt-45658-  KING HENRY. In any case be not too rough in terms,
shakes.txt-45659-    For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.
shakes.txt-45660-  BUCKINGHAM. I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal
--
--
shakes.txt-45942-
shakes.txt-45943-               Enter the EARLS OF WARWICK and SALISBURY
shakes.txt-45944-
shakes.txt:45945:  CLIFFORD. Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to death,
shakes.txt-45946-    And manacle the berard in their chains,
shakes.txt-45947-    If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place.
shakes.txt-45948-  RICHARD. Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
--
--
shakes.txt-45958-  KING HENRY. Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
shakes.txt-45959-    Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
shakes.txt-45960-    Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son!
shakes.txt:45961:    What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian
shakes.txt-45962-    And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
shakes.txt-45963-    O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
shakes.txt-45964-    If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
--
--
shakes.txt-45988-  QUEEN. A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
shakes.txt-45989-  KING HENRY. Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
shakes.txt-45990-  YORK. Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
shakes.txt:45991:    I am resolv'd for death or dignity.  
shakes.txt-45992-  CLIFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
shakes.txt-45993-  WARWICK. You were best to go to bed and dream again
shakes.txt-45994-    To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
--
--
shakes.txt-46041-
shakes.txt-46042-  WARWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come.
shakes.txt-46043-  YORK. Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
shakes.txt:46044:    For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
shakes.txt-46045-  WARWICK. Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
shakes.txt-46046-    As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,
shakes.txt-46047-    It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.            Exit
--
--
shakes.txt-46104-  RICHARD. So, lie thou there;
shakes.txt-46105-    For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
shakes.txt-46106-    The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset
shakes.txt:46107:    Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
shakes.txt-46108-    Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
shakes.txt-46109-    Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.             Exit
shakes.txt-46110-
--
--
shakes.txt-46165-    By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
shakes.txt-46166-    God knows how long it is I have to live,
shakes.txt-46167-    And it hath pleas'd Him that three times to-day
shakes.txt:46168:    You have defended me from imminent death.
shakes.txt-46169-    Well, lords, we have not got that which we have;
shakes.txt-46170-    'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
shakes.txt-46171-    Being opposites of such repairing nature.
--
--
shakes.txt-46372-    Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
shakes.txt-46373-  CLIFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words
shakes.txt-46374-    I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
shakes.txt:46375:    As shall revenge his death before I stir.
shakes.txt-46376-  WARWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
shakes.txt-46377-  YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown?
shakes.txt-46378-    If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
--
--
shakes.txt-46582-  RICHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-
shakes.txt-46583-    The crown of England, father, which is yours.
shakes.txt-46584-  YORK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
shakes.txt:46585:  RICHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.
shakes.txt-46586-  EDWARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
shakes.txt-46587-    By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
shakes.txt-46588-    It will outrun you, father, in the end.  
--
--
shakes.txt-46701-    And till I root out their accursed line
shakes.txt-46702-    And leave not one alive, I live in hell.  
shakes.txt-46703-    Therefore-
shakes.txt:46704:  RUTLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!
shakes.txt-46705-    To thee I pray: sweet Clifford, pity me.
shakes.txt-46706-  CLIFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
shakes.txt-46707-  RUTLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
--
--
shakes.txt-46736-    Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.
shakes.txt-46737-    My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;
shakes.txt-46738-    But this I know- they have demean'd themselves
shakes.txt:46739:    Like men born to renown by life or death.
shakes.txt-46740-    Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
shakes.txt-46741-    And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
shakes.txt-46742-    And full as oft came Edward to my side
--
--
shakes.txt-46816-    Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
shakes.txt-46817-    That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point
shakes.txt-46818-    Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
shakes.txt:46819:    And if thine eyes can water for his death,
shakes.txt-46820-    I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
shakes.txt-46821-    Alas, poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
shakes.txt-46822-    I should lament thy miserable state.
--
--
shakes.txt-46822-    I should lament thy miserable state.
shakes.txt-46823-    I prithee grieve to make me merry, York.
shakes.txt-46824-    What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
shakes.txt:46825:    That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
shakes.txt-46826-    Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;
shakes.txt-46827-    And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus.
shakes.txt-46828-    Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.  
--
--
shakes.txt-46837-    But how is it that great Plantagenet
shakes.txt-46838-    Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath?
shakes.txt-46839-    As I bethink me, you should not be King
shakes.txt:46840:    Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
shakes.txt-46841-    And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
shakes.txt-46842-    And rob his temples of the diadem,
shakes.txt-46843-    Now in his life, against your holy oath?
--
--
shakes.txt-46862-    Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
shakes.txt-46863-    It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen;
shakes.txt-46864-    Unless the adage must be verified,
shakes.txt:46865:    That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
shakes.txt-46866-    'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
shakes.txt-46867-    But, God He knows, thy share thereof is small.
shakes.txt-46868-    'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
--
--
shakes.txt-46883-    For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
shakes.txt-46884-    And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
shakes.txt-46885-    These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies;
shakes.txt:46886:    And every drop cries vengeance for his death
shakes.txt-46887-    'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.
shakes.txt-46888-  NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so  
shakes.txt-46889-    That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.
--
--
shakes.txt-46910-  QUEEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
shakes.txt-46911-    Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
shakes.txt-46912-    And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
shakes.txt:46913:  CLIFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
shakes.txt-46914-                                                  [Stabbing him]
shakes.txt-46915-  QUEEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
shakes.txt-46916-                                                  [Stabbing him]
--
--
shakes.txt-47029-    And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
shakes.txt-47030-    To weep is to make less the depth of grief.
shakes.txt-47031-    Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me!
shakes.txt:47032:    Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
shakes.txt-47033-    Or die renowned by attempting it.
shakes.txt-47034-  EDWARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
shakes.txt-47035-    His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
--
--
shakes.txt-47048-    O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
shakes.txt-47049-  EDWARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet
shakes.txt-47050-    Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption
shakes.txt:47051:    Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
shakes.txt-47052-  WARWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
shakes.txt-47053-    And now, to add more measure to your woes,
shakes.txt-47054-    I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
--
--
shakes.txt-47072-    That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,
shakes.txt-47073-    Or whether 'twas report of her success,
shakes.txt-47074-    Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
shakes.txt:47075:    Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
shakes.txt-47076-    I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,
shakes.txt-47077-    Their weapons like to lightning came and went:
shakes.txt-47078-    Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight
--
--
shakes.txt-47233-    And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.
shakes.txt-47234-  PRINCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
shakes.txt-47235-    I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
shakes.txt:47236:    And in that quarrel use it to the death.
shakes.txt-47237-  CLIFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
shakes.txt-47238-
shakes.txt-47239-                      Enter a MESSENGER
--
--
shakes.txt-47371-
shakes.txt-47372-                     Enter EDWARD, running
shakes.txt-47373-
shakes.txt:47374:  EDWARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;
shakes.txt-47375-    For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
shakes.txt-47376-  WARWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?
shakes.txt-47377-
--
--
shakes.txt-47388-  RICHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
shakes.txt-47389-    Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
shakes.txt-47390-    Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
shakes.txt:47391:    And in the very pangs of death he cried,
shakes.txt-47392-    Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,
--
shakes.txt-47392-    Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,
shakes.txt:47393:    'Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death.'
shakes.txt-47394-    So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
shakes.txt-47395-    That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
shakes.txt-47396-    The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
--
--
shakes.txt-47402-    Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
shakes.txt-47403-    Here on my knee I vow to God above
shakes.txt-47404-    I'll never pause again, never stand still,
shakes.txt:47405:    Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine
shakes.txt-47406-    Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
shakes.txt-47407-  EDWARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
shakes.txt-47408-    And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
--
--
shakes.txt-47444-  CLIFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.
shakes.txt-47445-    This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;
shakes.txt-47446-    And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
shakes.txt:47447:    And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
shakes.txt-47448-    And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
shakes.txt-47449-    To execute the like upon thyself;
shakes.txt-47450-    And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]
--
--
shakes.txt-47452-                 Enter WARWICK; CLIFFORD flies
shakes.txt-47453-
shakes.txt-47454-  RICHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;
shakes.txt:47455:    For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.            Exeunt
shakes.txt-47456-
shakes.txt-47457-
shakes.txt-47458-
--
--
shakes.txt-47564-    O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
shakes.txt-47565-    And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
shakes.txt-47566-  KING HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
shakes.txt:47567:    O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
shakes.txt-47568-    O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
shakes.txt-47569-    The red rose and the white are on his face,
shakes.txt-47570-    The fatal colours of our striving houses:
--
--
shakes.txt-47572-    The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth.
shakes.txt-47573-    Wither one rose, and let the other flourish!
shakes.txt-47574-    If you contend, a thousand lives must perish.
shakes.txt:47575:  SON. How will my mother for a father's death
shakes.txt-47576-    Take on with me, and ne'er be satisfied!
shakes.txt-47577-  FATHER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son
shakes.txt-47578-    Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied!
--
--
shakes.txt-47578-    Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied!
shakes.txt-47579-  KING HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances
shakes.txt-47580-    Misthink the King, and not be satisfied!
shakes.txt:47581:  SON. Was ever son so rued a father's death?  
shakes.txt-47582-  FATHER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
shakes.txt-47583-  KING HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?
shakes.txt-47584-    Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
--
--
shakes.txt-47602-
shakes.txt-47603-  PRINCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,
shakes.txt-47604-    And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.
shakes.txt:47605:    Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
shakes.txt-47606-  QUEEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.
shakes.txt-47607-    Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
shakes.txt-47608-    Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
--
--
shakes.txt-47642-    Giving no ground unto the house of York,
shakes.txt-47643-    They never then had sprung like summer flies;  
shakes.txt-47644-    I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
shakes.txt:47645:    Had left no mourning widows for our death;
shakes.txt-47646-    And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
shakes.txt-47647-    For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
shakes.txt-47648-    And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
--
--
shakes.txt-47672-    And, whereso'er he is, he's surely dead.
shakes.txt-47673-                                     [CLIFFORD groans, and dies]
shakes.txt-47674-  RICHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
shakes.txt:47675:    A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
shakes.txt-47676-    See who it is.
shakes.txt-47677-  EDWARD. And now the battle's ended,
shakes.txt-47678-    If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
--
--
shakes.txt-47687-    Instead whereof let this supply the room.
shakes.txt-47688-    Measure for measure must be answered.
shakes.txt-47689-  EDWARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
shakes.txt:47690:    That nothing sung but death to us and ours.
shakes.txt:47691:    Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound,
shakes.txt-47692-    And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
shakes.txt-47693-  WARWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
shakes.txt-47694-    Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
--
--
shakes.txt-47692-    And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
shakes.txt-47693-  WARWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.
shakes.txt-47694-    Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
shakes.txt:47695:    Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
shakes.txt-47696-    And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
shakes.txt-47697-  RICHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
shakes.txt-47698-    'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
--
--
shakes.txt-47697-  RICHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.
shakes.txt-47698-    'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
shakes.txt-47699-    Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
shakes.txt:47700:    Which in the time of death he gave our father.
shakes.txt-47701-  GEORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
shakes.txt-47702-  RICHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
shakes.txt-47703-  EDWARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.  
--
--
shakes.txt-47954-  LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
shakes.txt-47955-  KING EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
shakes.txt-47956-    What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?
shakes.txt:47957:  LADY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
shakes.txt-47958-    That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
shakes.txt-47959-  KING EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
shakes.txt-47960-  LADY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
--
--
shakes.txt-48211-    For shame! Leave Henry, and call Edward king.
shakes.txt-48212-  OXFORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom
shakes.txt-48213-    My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
shakes.txt:48214:    Was done to death; and more than so, my father,
shakes.txt-48215-    Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
--
shakes.txt-48215-    Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
shakes.txt:48216:    When nature brought him to the door of death?
shakes.txt-48217-    No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
shakes.txt-48218-    This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
shakes.txt-48219-  WARWICK. And I the house of York.
--
--
shakes.txt-48302-    No more my king, for he dishonours me,
shakes.txt-48303-    But most himself, if he could see his shame.
shakes.txt-48304-    Did I forget that by the house of York
shakes.txt:48305:    My father came untimely to his death?
shakes.txt-48306-    Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece?
shakes.txt-48307-    Did I impale him with the regal crown?
shakes.txt-48308-    Did I put Henry from his native right?
--
--
shakes.txt-49276-    Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
shakes.txt-49277-    Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
shakes.txt-49278-    And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
shakes.txt:49279:    These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,  
shakes.txt-49280-    Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun
shakes.txt-49281-    To search the secret treasons of the world;
shakes.txt-49282-    The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,
--
--
shakes.txt-49391-    Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
shakes.txt-49392-    Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink.
shakes.txt-49393-    Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
shakes.txt:49394:    Or else you famish- that's a threefold death.
shakes.txt-49395-    This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
shakes.txt-49396-    If case some one of you would fly from us,
shakes.txt-49397-    That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers  
--
--
shakes.txt-49533-    The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse.
shakes.txt-49534-    But if you ever chance to have a child,
shakes.txt-49535-    Look in his youth to have him so cut off
shakes.txt:49536:    As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
shakes.txt-49537-  KING EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.  
shakes.txt-49538-  QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
--
shakes.txt-49537-  KING EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.  
shakes.txt-49538-  QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.
shakes.txt:49539:    Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.
shakes.txt-49540-    What, wilt thou not? Then, Clarence, do it thou.
shakes.txt-49541-  CLARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
shakes.txt-49542-  QUEEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
--
--
shakes.txt-49577-  KING HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
shakes.txt-49578-    So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,
shakes.txt-49579-    And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
shakes.txt:49580:    What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
shakes.txt-49581-  GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:
shakes.txt-49582-    The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
shakes.txt-49583-  KING HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush
--
--
shakes.txt-49609-    And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,
shakes.txt-49610-    And many an orphan's water-standing eye-
shakes.txt-49611-    Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
shakes.txt:49612:    Orphans for their parents' timeless death-
shakes.txt-49613-    Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
shakes.txt-49614-    The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign;
shakes.txt-49615-    The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
--
--
shakes.txt-49631-    O, God forgive my sins and pardon thee!               [Dies]
shakes.txt-49632-  GLOUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
shakes.txt-49633-    Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
shakes.txt:49634:    See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death.
shakes.txt-49635-    O, may such purple tears be always shed
shakes.txt-49636-    From those that wish the downfall of our house!
shakes.txt-49637-    If any spark of life be yet remaining,
--
--
shakes.txt-49657-    But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
shakes.txt-49658-    For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
shakes.txt-49659-    That Edward shall be fearful of his life;
shakes.txt:49660:    And then to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
shakes.txt-49661-    King Henry and the Prince his son are gone.
shakes.txt-49662-    Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest;
shakes.txt-49663-    Counting myself but bad till I be best.
--
--
shakes.txt-50416-  SANDYS. They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,
shakes.txt-50417-    That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
shakes.txt-50418-    Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.
shakes.txt:50419:  CHAMBERLAIN. Death! my lord,
shakes.txt-50420-    Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't,  
shakes.txt-50421-    That sure th' have worn out Christendom.
shakes.txt-50422-
--
--
shakes.txt-50728-    And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;
shakes.txt-50729-    But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
shakes.txt-50730-    In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
shakes.txt:50731:  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death.
shakes.txt-50732-  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sure, he does not;
shakes.txt-50733-    He never was so womanish; the cause
shakes.txt-50734-    He may a little grieve at.
--
--
shakes.txt-50768-    And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,
shakes.txt-50769-    And if I have a conscience, let it sink me
shakes.txt-50770-    Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
shakes.txt:50771:    The law I bear no malice for my death:
shakes.txt-50772-    'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
shakes.txt-50773-    But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.
shakes.txt-50774-    Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em;
--
--
shakes.txt-51690-  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
shakes.txt-51691-  QUEEN KATHARINE. My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
shakes.txt-51692-    To give up willingly that noble title
shakes.txt:51693:    Your master wed me to: nothing but death
shakes.txt-51694-    Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
shakes.txt-51695-  WOLSEY. Pray hear me.
shakes.txt-51696-  QUEEN KATHARINE. Would I had never trod this English earth,
--
--
shakes.txt-51799-  CHAMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts
shakes.txt-51800-    And hedges his own way. But in this point
shakes.txt-51801-    All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
shakes.txt:51802:    After his patient's death: the King already
shakes.txt-51803-    Hath married the fair lady.
shakes.txt-51804-  SURREY. Would he had!
shakes.txt-51805-  SUFFOLK. May you be happy in your wish, my lord!  
--
--
shakes.txt-51979-    Can nothing render but allegiant thanks;
shakes.txt-51980-    My pray'rs to heaven for you; my loyalty,
shakes.txt-51981-    Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
shakes.txt:51982:    Till death, that winter, kill it.
shakes.txt-51983-  KING. Fairly answer'd!
shakes.txt-51984-    A loyal and obedient subject is
shakes.txt-51985-    Therein illustrated; the honour of it  
--
--
shakes.txt-52518-and PATIENCE, her woman
shakes.txt-52519-
shakes.txt-52520-  GRIFFITH. How does your Grace?
shakes.txt:52521:  KATHARINE. O Griffith, sick to death!
shakes.txt-52522-    My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth,
shakes.txt-52523-    Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.
shakes.txt-52524-    So-now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
--
--
shakes.txt-52592-    And found the blessedness of being little.
shakes.txt-52593-    And, to add greater honours to his age  
shakes.txt-52594-    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.
shakes.txt:52595:  KATHARINE. After my death I wish no other herald,
shakes.txt-52596-    No other speaker of my living actions,
shakes.txt-52597-    To keep mine honour from corruption,
shakes.txt-52598-    But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
--
--
shakes.txt-52727-  KATHARINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
shakes.txt-52728-    In all humility unto his Highness;
shakes.txt-52729-    Say his long trouble now is passing
shakes.txt:52730:    Out of this world. Tell him in death I bless'd him,
shakes.txt-52731-    For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
shakes.txt-52732-    My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
shakes.txt-52733-    You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;  
--
--
shakes.txt-52842-  KING. What say'st thou, ha?
shakes.txt-52843-    To pray for her? What, is she crying out?
shakes.txt-52844-  LOVELL. So said her woman; and that her suff'rance made
shakes.txt:52845:    Almost each pang a death.
shakes.txt-52846-  KING. Alas, good lady!
shakes.txt-52847-  SUFFOLK. God safely quit her of her burden, and
shakes.txt-52848-    With gentle travail, to the gladding of
--
--
shakes.txt-53704-    Between my father and my mother lay,  
shakes.txt-53705-    As I have heard my father speak himself,
shakes.txt-53706-    When this same lusty gentleman was got.
shakes.txt:53707:    Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
shakes.txt:53708:    His lands to me, and took it on his death
shakes.txt-53709-    That this my mother's son was none of his;
shakes.txt-53710-    And if he were, he came into the world
shakes.txt-53711-    Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
--
--
shakes.txt-53749-  BASTARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
shakes.txt-53750-    Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
shakes.txt-53751-    Yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.
shakes.txt:53752:    Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
shakes.txt-53753-  ELINOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
shakes.txt-53754-  BASTARD. Our country manners give our betters way.
shakes.txt-53755-  KING JOHN. What is thy name?
--
--
shakes.txt-53912-    And to rebuke the usurpation
shakes.txt-53913-    Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.
shakes.txt-53914-    Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
shakes.txt:53915:  ARTHUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
shakes.txt-53916-    The rather that you give his offspring life,
shakes.txt-53917-    Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
shakes.txt-53918-    I give you welcome with a powerless hand,  
--
--
shakes.txt-54279-    With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
shakes.txt-54280-  BASTARD. Ha, majesty! how high thy glory tow'rs
shakes.txt-54281-    When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
shakes.txt:54282:    O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
shakes.txt-54283-    The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
shakes.txt-54284-    And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
shakes.txt-54285-    In undetermin'd differences of kings.
--
--
shakes.txt-54287-    Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
shakes.txt-54288-    You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
shakes.txt-54289-    Then let confusion of one part confirm
shakes.txt:54290:    The other's peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death!
shakes.txt-54291-  KING JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
shakes.txt-54292-  KING PHILIP. Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
shakes.txt-54293-  CITIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King.
--
--
shakes.txt-54303-  BASTARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
shakes.txt-54304-    And stand securely on their battlements
shakes.txt-54305-    As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
shakes.txt:54306:    At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
shakes.txt-54307-    Your royal presences be rul'd by me:
shakes.txt-54308-    Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
shakes.txt-54309-    Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend
--
--
shakes.txt-54381-    And give you entrance; but without this match,
shakes.txt-54382-    The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
shakes.txt-54383-    Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
shakes.txt:54384:    More free from motion-no, not Death himself
shakes.txt-54385-    In mortal fury half so peremptory
shakes.txt-54386-    As we to keep this city.
shakes.txt-54387-  BASTARD. Here's a stay
--
--
shakes.txt-54385-    In mortal fury half so peremptory
shakes.txt-54386-    As we to keep this city.
shakes.txt-54387-  BASTARD. Here's a stay
shakes.txt:54388:    That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
shakes.txt-54389-    Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
--
shakes.txt-54389-    Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
shakes.txt:54390:    That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;
shakes.txt-54391-    Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
shakes.txt-54392-    As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
shakes.txt-54393-    What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
--
--
shakes.txt-54777-  BLANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
shakes.txt-54778-    But from her need.
shakes.txt-54779-  CONSTANCE. O, if thou grant my need,
shakes.txt:54780:    Which only lives but by the death of faith,
shakes.txt-54781-    That need must needs infer this principle-
--
shakes.txt-54781-    That need must needs infer this principle-
shakes.txt:54782:    That faith would live again by death of need.
shakes.txt-54783-    O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up:
shakes.txt-54784-    Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
shakes.txt-54785-  KING JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
--
--
shakes.txt-55013-    But, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well;
shakes.txt-55014-    And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
shakes.txt-55015-  HUBERT. So well that what you bid me undertake,
shakes.txt:55016:    Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
shakes.txt-55017-    By heaven, I would do it.
shakes.txt-55018-  KING JOHN. Do not I know thou wouldst?
shakes.txt-55019-    Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
--
--
shakes.txt-55024-    Thou art his keeper.
shakes.txt-55025-  HUBERT. And I'll keep him so
shakes.txt-55026-    That he shall not offend your Majesty.
shakes.txt:55027:  KING JOHN. Death.
shakes.txt-55028-  HUBERT. My lord?
shakes.txt-55029-  KING JOHN. A grave.
shakes.txt-55030-  HUBERT. He shall not live.  
--
--
shakes.txt-55074-  KING PHILIP. Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
shakes.txt-55075-  CONSTANCE. No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
shakes.txt-55076-    But that which ends all counsel, true redress-
shakes.txt:55077:    Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
shakes.txt-55078-    Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness!
shakes.txt-55079-    Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
shakes.txt-55080-    Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
--
--
shakes.txt-55504-    Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.
shakes.txt-55505-    His passion is so ripe it needs must break.
shakes.txt-55506-  PEMBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
shakes.txt:55507:    The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
shakes.txt-55508-  KING JOHN. We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
shakes.txt-55509-    Good lords, although my will to give is living,
shakes.txt-55510-    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
--
--
shakes.txt-55510-    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
shakes.txt-55511-    He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.
shakes.txt-55512-  SALISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
shakes.txt:55513:  PEMBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
shakes.txt-55514-    Before the child himself felt he was sick.
shakes.txt-55515-    This must be answer'd either here or hence.
shakes.txt-55516-  KING JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
--
--
shakes.txt-55528-    To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.            Exeunt LORDS
shakes.txt-55529-  KING JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent.
shakes.txt-55530-    There is no sure foundation set on blood,
shakes.txt:55531:    No certain life achiev'd by others' death.
shakes.txt-55532-

shakes.txt-55629-  KING JOHN. Five moons!
shakes.txt-55630-  HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the streets
shakes.txt-55631-    Do prophesy upon it dangerously;
shakes.txt:55632:    Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;
shakes.txt-55633-    And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
shakes.txt-55634-    And whisper one another in the ear;
shakes.txt-55635-    And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
--
--
shakes.txt-55644-    Told of a many thousand warlike French
shakes.txt-55645-    That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.
shakes.txt-55646-    Another lean unwash'd artificer
shakes.txt:55647:    Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur's death.
shakes.txt-55648-  KING JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
--
shakes.txt-55648-  KING JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
shakes.txt:55649:    Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
shakes.txt-55650-    Thy hand hath murd'red him. I had a mighty cause
shakes.txt-55651-    To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
shakes.txt-55652-  HUBERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
--
--
shakes.txt-55669-    But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
shakes.txt-55670-    Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,
shakes.txt-55671-    Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
shakes.txt:55672:    I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
shakes.txt-55673-    And thou, to be endeared to a king,
shakes.txt-55674-    Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
shakes.txt-55675-  HUBERT. My lord-
--
--
shakes.txt-55690-    Nay, in the body of the fleshly land,
shakes.txt-55691-    This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
shakes.txt-55692-    Hostility and civil tumult reigns
shakes.txt:55693:    Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
shakes.txt-55694-  HUBERT. Arm you against your other enemies,
shakes.txt-55695-    I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
shakes.txt-55696-    Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine
--
--
shakes.txt-55763-  PEMBROKE. Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
shakes.txt-55764-  BASTARD. 'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
shakes.txt-55765-  SALISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here?
shakes.txt:55766:  PEMBROKE. O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
shakes.txt-55767-    The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
shakes.txt-55768-  SALISBURY. Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
shakes.txt-55769-    Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
--
--
shakes.txt-55807-
shakes.txt-55808-  HUBERT. Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
shakes.txt-55809-    Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you.
shakes.txt:55810:  SALISBURY. O, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
shakes.txt-55811-    Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
shakes.txt-55812-  HUBERT. I am no villain.
shakes.txt-55813-  SALISBURY. Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]

shakes.txt-55854-                                                         Exeunt LORDS
shakes.txt-55855-  BASTARD. Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
shakes.txt-55856-    Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
shakes.txt:55857:    Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
shakes.txt-55858-    Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
shakes.txt-55859-  HUBERT. Do but hear me, sir.
shakes.txt-55860-  BASTARD. Ha! I'll tell thee what:  
--
--
shakes.txt-56132-    Before I drew this gallant head of war,
shakes.txt-56133-    And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
shakes.txt-56134-    To outlook conquest, and to will renown
shakes.txt:56135:    Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
shakes.txt-56136-                                                     [Trumpet sounds]
shakes.txt-56137-    What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
shakes.txt-56138-
--
--
shakes.txt-56199-    Not trusting to this halting legate here,
shakes.txt-56200-    Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need-
shakes.txt-56201-    Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
shakes.txt:56202:    A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
shakes.txt-56203-    To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
shakes.txt-56204-  LEWIS. Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
shakes.txt-56205-  BASTARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
--
--
shakes.txt-56256-  MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.
shakes.txt-56257-  SALISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.
shakes.txt-56258-  PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun.
shakes.txt:56259:  SALISBURY. Wounded to death.
shakes.txt-56260-  MELUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
shakes.txt-56261-    Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
shakes.txt-56262-    And welcome home again discarded faith.  
--
--
shakes.txt-56269-    Even on that altar where we swore to you
shakes.txt-56270-    Dear amity and everlasting love.
shakes.txt-56271-  SALISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?
shakes.txt:56272:  MELUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,
shakes.txt-56273-    Retaining but a quantity of life,
shakes.txt-56274-    Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
shakes.txt-56275-    Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
--
--
shakes.txt-56306-    And calmly run on in obedience
shakes.txt-56307-    Even to our ocean, to great King John.
shakes.txt-56308-    My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
shakes.txt:56309:    For I do see the cruel pangs of death
shakes.txt-56310-    Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,
shakes.txt-56311-    And happy newness, that intends old right.
shakes.txt-56312-                                            Exeunt, leading off MELUN
--
--
shakes.txt-56432-    Than when you left him; even now he sung.  
shakes.txt-56433-  PRINCE HENRY. O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
shakes.txt-56434-    In their continuance will not feel themselves.
shakes.txt:56435:    Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
shakes.txt-56436-    Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
shakes.txt-56437-    Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
shakes.txt-56438-    With many legions of strange fantasies,

shakes.txt-56437-    Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
shakes.txt-56438-    With many legions of strange fantasies,
shakes.txt-56439-    Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
shakes.txt:56440:    Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.
shakes.txt-56441-    I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
--
shakes.txt-56441-    I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
shakes.txt:56442:    Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
shakes.txt-56443-    And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
shakes.txt-56444-    His soul and body to their lasting rest.
shakes.txt-56445-  SALISBURY. Be of good comfort, Prince; for you are born

shakes.txt:56582:  MARK ANTONY, general and friend of Caesar, a Triumvir after his death
shakes.txt-56583-  LEPIDUS, third member of the Triumvirate
shakes.txt-56584-  MARCUS BRUTUS, leader of the conspiracy against Caesar
shakes.txt-56585-  CASSIUS, instigator of the conspiracy
--
--
shakes.txt-56817-    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
shakes.txt-56818-    What is it that you would impart to me?
shakes.txt-56819-    If it be aught toward the general good,
shakes.txt:56820:    Set honor in one eye and death i' the other  
shakes.txt-56821-    And I will look on both indifferently.
shakes.txt-56822-    For let the gods so speed me as I love
--
shakes.txt-56821-    And I will look on both indifferently.
shakes.txt-56822-    For let the gods so speed me as I love
shakes.txt:56823:    The name of honor more than I fear death.
shakes.txt-56824-  CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
shakes.txt-56825-    As well as I do know your outward favor.
shakes.txt-56826-    Well, honor is the subject of my story.
--
--
shakes.txt-57269-  BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
shakes.txt-57270-    When it is lighted, come and call me here.
shakes.txt-57271-  LUCIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
shakes.txt:57272:  BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,
shakes.txt-57273-    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
shakes.txt-57274-    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
shakes.txt-57275-    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
--
--
shakes.txt-57448-    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
shakes.txt-57449-  BRUTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
shakes.txt-57450-    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
shakes.txt:57451:    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
shakes.txt-57452-    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
shakes.txt-57453-    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
shakes.txt-57454-    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
--
--
shakes.txt-57681-    Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions
shakes.txt-57682-    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
shakes.txt-57683-  CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;  
shakes.txt:57684:    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
shakes.txt:57685:  CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;
shakes.txt:57686:    The valiant never taste of death but once.
shakes.txt-57687-    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
shakes.txt-57688-    It seems to me most strange that men should fear

shakes.txt-57687-    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
shakes.txt-57688-    It seems to me most strange that men should fear

shakes.txt-57690-    Will come when it will come.
shakes.txt-57691-
shakes.txt-57692-                      Re-enter Servant.
--
--
shakes.txt-57874-    Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,
shakes.txt-57875-    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
shakes.txt-57876-    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
shakes.txt:57877:    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
shakes.txt-57878-    I'll get me to a place more void and there
shakes.txt-57879-    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.               Exit.
shakes.txt-57880-  PORTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
--
--
shakes.txt-58030-    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
shakes.txt-58031-    And drawing days out that men stand upon.
shakes.txt-58032-  CASSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
shakes.txt:58033:    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
shakes.txt:58034:  BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
shakes.txt-58035-    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
--
shakes.txt-58035-    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
shakes.txt:58036:    His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
shakes.txt-58037-    And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
shakes.txt-58038-    Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;
shakes.txt-58039-    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,
--
--
shakes.txt-58065-    Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.
shakes.txt-58066-    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
shakes.txt-58067-    May safely come to him and be resolved
shakes.txt:58068:    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
shakes.txt-58069-    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
shakes.txt-58070-    So well as Brutus living, but will follow
shakes.txt-58071-    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
--
--
shakes.txt-58091-    I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
shakes.txt-58092-    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.
shakes.txt-58093-    If I myself, there is no hour so fit
shakes.txt:58094:    As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument
shakes.txt-58095-    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
shakes.txt-58096-    With the most noble blood of all this world.
shakes.txt-58097-    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

shakes.txt-58098-    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
shakes.txt-58099-    Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
shakes.txt-58100-    I shall not find myself so apt to die;
shakes.txt:58101:    No place will please me so, no means of death,
shakes.txt-58102-    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
shakes.txt-58103-    The choice and master spirits of this age.
--
shakes.txt-58102-    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
shakes.txt-58103-    The choice and master spirits of this age.
shakes.txt:58104:  BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!  
shakes.txt-58105-    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
shakes.txt-58106-    As, by our hands and this our present act
shakes.txt-58107-    You see we do, yet see you but our hands
--
--
shakes.txt-58134-    Either a coward or a flatterer.
shakes.txt-58135-    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!
shakes.txt-58136-    If then thy spirit look upon us now,
shakes.txt:58137:    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
shakes.txt-58138-    To see thy Antony making his peace,
shakes.txt-58139-    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
shakes.txt-58140-    Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?

shakes.txt-58179-    By that which he will utter?
shakes.txt-58180-  BRUTUS. By your pardon,
shakes.txt-58181-    I will myself into the pulpit first,
shakes.txt:58182:    And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
shakes.txt-58183-    What Antony shall speak, I will protest
shakes.txt-58184-    He speaks by leave and by permission,  
shakes.txt-58185-    And that we are contented Caesar shall

shakes.txt:58264:    Of Caesar's death.
shakes.txt-58265-  FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.
shakes.txt-58266-  SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,
shakes.txt-58267-    When severally we hear them rendered.

--
shakes.txt-58282-    weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
shakes.txt-58283-    valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There
shakes.txt-58284-    is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor,
shakes.txt:58285:    and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
shakes.txt-58286-    bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so
shakes.txt-58287-    rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I
shakes.txt-58288-    offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If

shakes.txt-58289-    any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
shakes.txt-58290-  ALL. None, Brutus, none.
shakes.txt-58291-  BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar
shakes.txt:58292:    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is
shakes.txt-58293-    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was

shakes.txt-58293-    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was  
shakes.txt:58294:    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

shakes.txt-58296-              Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.
shakes.txt-58297-

shakes.txt-58298-    Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had
shakes.txt:58299:    no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a
shakes.txt-58300-    place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this I

shakes.txt-58507-  ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
shakes.txt-58508-    To every Roman citizen he gives,
shakes.txt-58509-    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
shakes.txt:58510:  SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
shakes.txt-58511-  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!
shakes.txt-58512-  ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
shakes.txt-58513-  ALL. Peace, ho!

shakes.txt-58879-    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet

shakes.txt-58885-
--

shakes.txt-58911-    Upon what sickness?
shakes.txt-58912-  BRUTUS. Impatient of my absence,
shakes.txt-58913-    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
shakes.txt:58914:    Have made themselves so strong- for with her death
shakes.txt-58915-    That tidings came- with this she fell distract,
shakes.txt-58916-    And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
shakes.txt-58917-  CASSIUS. And died so?  
--
--
shakes.txt-58942-  BRUTUS. With what addition?
shakes.txt-58943-  MESSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry
shakes.txt-58944-    Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
shakes.txt:58945:    Have put to death an hundred senators.
shakes.txt-58946-  BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;
shakes.txt-58947-    Mine speak of seventy senators that died
shakes.txt-58948-    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
--
--
shakes.txt-59248-    The very last time we shall speak together.  
shakes.txt-59249-    What are you then determined to do?
shakes.txt-59250-  BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy
shakes.txt:59251:    By which I did blame Cato for the death
shakes.txt-59252-    Which he did give himself- I know not how,
shakes.txt-59253-    But I do find it cowardly and vile,
shakes.txt-59254-    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent

shakes.txt-59452-  FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.
shakes.txt-59453-  LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die.
shakes.txt-59454-    [Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:
shakes.txt:59455:    Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.
shakes.txt-59456-  FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!  
shakes.txt-59457-  SECOND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
shakes.txt-59458-  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
--
--
shakes.txt-59552-  STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
shakes.txt-59553-    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
shakes.txt-59554-    For Brutus only overcame himself,
shakes.txt:59555:    And no man else hath honor by his death.
shakes.txt-59556-  LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
shakes.txt-59557-    That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
shakes.txt-59558-  OCTAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
--
--
shakes.txt-59701-     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
shakes.txt-59702-     To shake all cares and business from our age,
shakes.txt-59703-     Conferring them on younger strengths while we
shakes.txt:59704:     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
shakes.txt-59705-     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
shakes.txt-59706-     We have this hour a constant will to publish
shakes.txt-59707-     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
--
--
shakes.txt-59851-     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
shakes.txt-59852-     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,
shakes.txt-59853-     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
shakes.txt:59854:     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
shakes.txt-59855-     This shall not be revok'd.
shakes.txt-59856-  Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,
shakes.txt-59857-     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
--
--
shakes.txt-60145-     what should follow these eclipses.
shakes.txt-60146-  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?
shakes.txt-60147-  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as
shakes.txt:60148:     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,
shakes.txt-60149-     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,
shakes.txt-60150-     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless
shakes.txt-60151-     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
--
--
shakes.txt-60546-  Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
shakes.txt-60547-     Within a fortnight?
shakes.txt-60548-  Alb. What's the matter, sir?
shakes.txt:60549:  Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd
shakes.txt-60550-     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;  
shakes.txt-60551-     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
shakes.txt-60552-     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
--
--
shakes.txt-60758-     By his authority I will proclaim it
shakes.txt-60759-     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,
shakes.txt-60760-     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;
shakes.txt:60761:     He that conceals him, death.
shakes.txt-60762-  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent
shakes.txt-60763-     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech  
shakes.txt-60764-     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,

--
shakes.txt-60770-     My very character), I'ld turn it all
shakes.txt-60771-     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
shakes.txt-60772-     And thou must make a dullard of the world,
shakes.txt:60773:     If they not thought the profits of my death
shakes.txt-60774-     Were very pregnant and potential spurs
shakes.txt-60775-     To make thee seek it.'
shakes.txt-60776-  Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!
--
--
shakes.txt-60799-  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!
shakes.txt-60800-  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
shakes.txt-60801-  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.
shakes.txt:60802:     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
shakes.txt-60803-     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.  
shakes.txt-60804-     I have this present evening from my sister
shakes.txt-60805-     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions

--
shakes.txt-61167-     You know the fiery quality of the Duke,
shakes.txt-61168-     How unremovable and fix'd he is
shakes.txt-61169-     In his own course.
shakes.txt:61170:  Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
shakes.txt-61171-     Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
shakes.txt-61172-     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
shakes.txt-61173-  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
--
--
shakes.txt-61184-     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;  
shakes.txt-61185-     And am fallen out with my more headier will,
shakes.txt-61186-     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
shakes.txt:61187:     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore
shakes.txt-61188-     Should be sit here? This act persuades me
shakes.txt-61189-     That this remotion of the Duke and her
shakes.txt-61190-     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
--
--
shakes.txt-61191-     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
shakes.txt-61192-     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
shakes.txt-61193-     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
shakes.txt:61194:     Till it cry sleep to death.
shakes.txt-61195-  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.
shakes.txt-61196-  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
shakes.txt-61197-  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she
--
--
shakes.txt-61726-  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
shakes.txt-61727-     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
shakes.txt-61728-  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.
shakes.txt:61729:  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
shakes.txt-61730-     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
shakes.txt-61731-     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
shakes.txt-61732-     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?  
--
--
shakes.txt-61820-     His wits begin t' unsettle.
shakes.txt-61821-  Glou. Canst thou blame him?
shakes.txt-61822-                                                    Storm still.
shakes.txt:61823:     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!
shakes.txt-61824-     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!
shakes.txt-61825-     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,
shakes.txt-61826-     I am almost mad myself. I had a son,
--
--
shakes.txt-61858-  Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to
shakes.txt-61859-     loyalty, something fears me to think of.
shakes.txt-61860-  Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil
shakes.txt:61861:     disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set
shakes.txt-61862-     awork by a reproveable badness in himself.
shakes.txt-61863-  Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!
shakes.txt-61864-     This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an
--
--
shakes.txt-61975-  Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?
shakes.txt-61976-  Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.
shakes.txt-61977-  Glou. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.
shakes.txt:61978:     I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.
shakes.txt-61979-     There is a litter ready; lay him in't
shakes.txt-61980-     And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
shakes.txt-61981-     Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.
--
--
shakes.txt-62140-  2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,
shakes.txt-62141-     If this man come to good.
shakes.txt-62142-  3. Serv. If she live long,
shakes.txt:62143:     And in the end meet the old course of death,
shakes.txt-62144-     Women will all turn monsters.
shakes.txt-62145-  2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam
shakes.txt-62146-     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness
--
--
shakes.txt-62299-     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
shakes.txt-62300-     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
shakes.txt-62301-     Conceive, and fare thee well.
shakes.txt:62302:  Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.
shakes.txt-62303-  Gon. My most dear Gloucester!
shakes.txt-62304-     O, the difference of man and man!
shakes.txt-62305-     To thee a woman's services are due;
--
--
shakes.txt-62642-     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
shakes.txt-62643-  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!
shakes.txt-62644-     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
shakes.txt:62645:     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort
shakes.txt-62646-     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
shakes.txt-62647-     And frustrate his proud will.
shakes.txt-62648-  Edg. Give me your arm.
--
--
shakes.txt-62851-     If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
shakes.txt-62852-     And give the letters which thou find'st about me
shakes.txt-62853-     To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out
shakes.txt:62854:     Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!
shakes.txt-62855-                                                        He dies.
shakes.txt-62856-  Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,
shakes.txt-62857-     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
--
--
shakes.txt-62860-  Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.
shakes.txt-62861-     Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of
shakes.txt-62862-     May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry
shakes.txt:62863:     He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
shakes.txt-62864-     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.
shakes.txt-62865-     To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
shakes.txt-62866-     Their papers, is more lawful.             Reads the letter.
--
--
shakes.txt-62880-     Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
shakes.txt-62881-     Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time
shakes.txt-62882-     With this ungracious paper strike the sight
shakes.txt:62883:     Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well
shakes.txt:62884:     That of thy death and business I can tell.
shakes.txt-62885-  Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,
shakes.txt-62886-     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
shakes.txt-62887-     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.
--
--
shakes.txt-63393-     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
shakes.txt-63394-     The bloody proclamation to escape
shakes.txt-63395-     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!
shakes.txt:63396:     That with the pain of death would hourly die
shakes.txt-63397-     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift
shakes.txt-63398-     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance
shakes.txt-63399-     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
--
--
shakes.txt-63656-
shakes.txt-63657-  KING. Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
shakes.txt-63658-    Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs,
shakes.txt:63659:    And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
shakes.txt-63660-    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
shakes.txt-63661-    Th' endeavour of this present breath may buy
shakes.txt-63662-    That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
--
--
shakes.txt-64885-    never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket
shakes.txt-64886-    that the Princess kill'd.
shakes.txt-64887-  HOLOFERNES. Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
shakes.txt:64888:    the death of the deer? And, to humour the ignorant, call the deer
shakes.txt-64889-    the Princess kill'd a pricket.
shakes.txt-64890-  NATHANIEL. Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please
shakes.txt-64891-    you to abrogate scurrility.
--
--
shakes.txt-65127-        Playing in the wanton air.
shakes.txt-65128-        Through the velvet leaves the wind,
shakes.txt-65129-        All unseen, can passage find;  
shakes.txt:65130:        That the lover, sick to death,
shakes.txt-65131-        Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.
shakes.txt-65132-        "Air," quoth he "thy cheeks may blow;
shakes.txt-65133-        Air, would I might triumph so!
--
--
shakes.txt-65739-    Upon the next occasion that we meet
shakes.txt-65740-    With visages display'd to talk and greet.
shakes.txt-65741-  ROSALINE. But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
shakes.txt:65742:  PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot,
shakes.txt-65743-    Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace;
shakes.txt-65744-    But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
shakes.txt-65745-  BOYET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,  
--
--
shakes.txt-66271-  HOLOFERNES. What is this?
shakes.txt-66272-  BOYET. A cittern-head.
shakes.txt-66273-  DUMAIN. The head of a bodkin.
shakes.txt:66274:  BEROWNE. A death's face in a ring.
shakes.txt-66275-  LONGAVILLE. The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
shakes.txt-66276-  BOYET. The pommel of Coesar's falchion.
shakes.txt-66277-  DUMAIN. The carv'd-bone face on a flask.
--
--
shakes.txt-66473-    I will be thine; and, till that instant, shut
shakes.txt-66474-    My woeful self up in a mournful house,
shakes.txt-66475-    Raining the tears of lamentation
shakes.txt:66476:    For the remembrance of my father's death.
shakes.txt-66477-    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
shakes.txt-66478-    Neither intitled in the other's heart.
shakes.txt-66479-  KING. If this, or more than this, I would deny,
--
--
shakes.txt-66478-    Neither intitled in the other's heart.
shakes.txt-66479-  KING. If this, or more than this, I would deny,
shakes.txt-66480-    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
shakes.txt:66481:    The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
shakes.txt-66482-    Hence hermit then, my heart is in thy breast.
shakes.txt-66483-  BEROWNE. And what to me, my love? and what to me?
shakes.txt-66484-  ROSALINE. You must he purged too, your sins are rack'd;
--
--
shakes.txt-66520-    With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
shakes.txt-66521-    With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,
shakes.txt-66522-    To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
shakes.txt:66523:  BEROWNE. To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
shakes.txt-66524-    It cannot be; it is impossible;
shakes.txt-66525-    Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
shakes.txt-66526-  ROSALINE. Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,  
--
--
shakes.txt-66793-    Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,
shakes.txt-66794-    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.  
shakes.txt-66795-  DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
shakes.txt:66796:    Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
shakes.txt-66797-    And with his former title greet Macbeth.
shakes.txt-66798-  ROSS. I'll see it done.
shakes.txt-66799-  DUNCAN. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
--
--
shakes.txt-66881-    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
shakes.txt-66882-  FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
shakes.txt-66883-  MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
shakes.txt:66884:    By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
shakes.txt-66885-    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,
shakes.txt-66886-    A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
shakes.txt-66887-    Stands not within the prospect of belief,

--
shakes.txt-66912-    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
shakes.txt-66913-    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
shakes.txt-66914-    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
shakes.txt:66915:    Strange images of death. As thick as hail
shakes.txt-66916-    Came post with post, and every one did bear
shakes.txt-66917-    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,
shakes.txt-66918-    And pour'd them down before him.
--
--
shakes.txt-67002-    Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth
shakes.txt-67003-    A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
shakes.txt-67004-    Became him like the leaving it; he died
shakes.txt:67005:    As one that had been studied in his death,
shakes.txt-67006-    To throw away the dearest thing he owed
shakes.txt-67007-    As 'twere a careless trifle.
shakes.txt-67008-  DUNCAN. There's no art
--
--
shakes.txt-67294-    That memory, the warder of the brain,  
shakes.txt-67295-    Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
shakes.txt-67296-    A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
shakes.txt:67297:    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
shakes.txt-67298-    What cannot you and I perform upon
shakes.txt-67299-    The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
shakes.txt-67300-    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
--
--
shakes.txt-67307-    That they have done't?
shakes.txt-67308-  LADY MACBETH. Who dares receive it other,
shakes.txt-67309-    As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
shakes.txt:67310:    Upon his death?
shakes.txt-67311-  MACBETH. I am settled and bend up
shakes.txt-67312-    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
shakes.txt-67313-    Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
--
--
shakes.txt-67425-    Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it:
shakes.txt-67426-    The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
shakes.txt-67427-    Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg'd their possets
shakes.txt:67428:    That death and nature do contend about them,
shakes.txt-67429-    Whether they live or die.
shakes.txt-67430-  MACBETH. [Within.] Who's there' what, ho!
shakes.txt-67431-  LADY MACBETH. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked
--
--
shakes.txt-67468-  MACBETH. I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!
shakes.txt-67469-    Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,
shakes.txt-67470-    Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care,
shakes.txt:67471:    The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
shakes.txt-67472-    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
shakes.txt-67473-    Chief nourisher in life's feast-
shakes.txt-67474-  LADY MACBETH. What do you mean?
--
--
shakes.txt-67583-  MACBETH. He does; he did appoint so.
shakes.txt-67584-  LENNOX. The night has been unruly. Where we lay,
shakes.txt-67585-    Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,
shakes.txt:67586:    Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,
shakes.txt-67587-    And prophesying with accents terrible
shakes.txt-67588-    Of dire combustion and confused events
shakes.txt-67589-    New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird
--
--
shakes.txt-67611-    Awake, awake!
shakes.txt-67612-    Ring the alarum bell. Murther and treason!
shakes.txt-67613-    Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm, awake!
shakes.txt:67614:    Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
shakes.txt:67615:    And look on death itself! Up, up, and see
shakes.txt-67616-    The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
shakes.txt-67617-    As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites
shakes.txt-67618-    To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.       Bell rings.
--
--
shakes.txt-67923-    Whose execution takes your enemy off,
shakes.txt-67924-    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
shakes.txt-67925-    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
shakes.txt:67926:    Which in his death were perfect.
shakes.txt-67927-  SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege,
shakes.txt-67928-    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
shakes.txt-67929-    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
--
--
shakes.txt-68127-    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?
shakes.txt-68128-  MURTHERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,
shakes.txt-68129-    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
shakes.txt:68130:    The least a death to nature.
shakes.txt-68131-  MACBETH. Thanks for that.
shakes.txt-68132-    There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled  
shakes.txt-68133-    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
--
--
shakes.txt-68285-  HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
shakes.txt-68286-    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
shakes.txt-68287-    To trade and traffic with Macbeth
shakes.txt:68288:    In riddles and affairs of death,
shakes.txt-68289-    And I, the mistress of your charms,
shakes.txt-68290-    The close contriver of all harms,
shakes.txt-68291-    Was never call'd to bear my part,
--
--
shakes.txt-68310-    Shall raise such artificial sprites
shakes.txt-68311-    As by the strength of their illusion
shakes.txt-68312-    Shall draw him on to his confusion.
shakes.txt:68313:    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
shakes.txt-68314-    His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.
shakes.txt-68315-    And you all know security
shakes.txt-68316-    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
--
--
shakes.txt-68963-  ROSS. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
shakes.txt-68964-    Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the manner
shakes.txt-68965-    Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer,
shakes.txt:68966:    To add the death of you.
shakes.txt-68967-  MALCOLM. Merciful heaven!
shakes.txt-68968-    What, man! Neer pull your hat upon your brows;
shakes.txt-68969-    Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
--
--
shakes.txt-69174-  SERVANT. Soldiers, sir.
shakes.txt-69175-  MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
shakes.txt-69176-    Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
shakes.txt:69177:    Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
shakes.txt-69178-    Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
shakes.txt-69179-  SERVANT. The English force, so please you.
shakes.txt-69180-  MACBETH. Take thy face hence.                    Exit Servant.
--
--
shakes.txt-69227-  DOCTOR. Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation
shakes.txt-69228-    Makes us hear something.
shakes.txt-69229-  MACBETH. Bring it after me.
shakes.txt:69230:    I will not be afraid of death and bane
shakes.txt-69231-    Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
shakes.txt-69232-  DOCTOR. [Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
shakes.txt-69233-    Profit again should hardly draw me here.             Exeunt.
--
--
shakes.txt-69305-    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
shakes.txt-69306-    To the last syllable of recorded time;
shakes.txt-69307-    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
shakes.txt:69308:    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
shakes.txt-69309-    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
shakes.txt-69310-    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
shakes.txt-69311-    And then is heard no more. It is a tale
--
--
shakes.txt-69361-    Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,
shakes.txt-69362-    Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
shakes.txt-69363-  MACDUFF. Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
shakes.txt:69364:    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
shakes.txt-69365-                                                         Exeunt.
shakes.txt-69366-
shakes.txt-69367-
--
--
shakes.txt-69496-  ROSS. Ay, on the front.
shakes.txt-69497-  SIWARD. Why then, God's soldier be he!
shakes.txt-69498-    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,  
shakes.txt:69499:    I would not wish them to a fairer death.
shakes.txt-69500-    And so his knell is knoll'd.
shakes.txt-69501-  MALCOLM. He's worth more sorrow,
shakes.txt-69502-    And that I'll spend for him.
--
--
shakes.txt-70097-    Their perch, and not their terror.
shakes.txt-70098-  ESCALUS. Ay, but yet
shakes.txt-70099-    Let us be keen, and rather cut a little
shakes.txt:70100:    Than fall and bruise to death. Alas! this gentleman,
shakes.txt-70101-    Whom I would save, had a most noble father.
shakes.txt-70102-    Let but your honour know,
shakes.txt-70103-    Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
--
--
shakes.txt-70121-    You may not so extenuate his offence
shakes.txt-70122-    For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
shakes.txt-70123-    When I, that censure him, do so offend,
shakes.txt:70124:    Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
shakes.txt-70125-    And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
shakes.txt-70126-  ESCALUS. Be it as your wisdom will.
shakes.txt-70127-  ANGELO. Where is the Provost?
--
--
shakes.txt-70340-  JUSTICE. Eleven, sir.
shakes.txt-70341-  ESCALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.
shakes.txt-70342-  JUSTICE. I humbly thank you.
shakes.txt:70343:  ESCALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
shakes.txt-70344-    But there's no remedy.
shakes.txt-70345-  JUSTICE. Lord Angelo is severe.
shakes.txt-70346-  ESCALUS. It is but needful:
--
--
shakes.txt-70470-    Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
shakes.txt-70471-    It should be thus with him. He must die to-morrow.
shakes.txt-70472-  ISABELLA. To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him.
shakes.txt:70473:    He's not prepar'd for death. Even for our kitchens
shakes.txt-70474-    We kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
shakes.txt-70475-    With less respect than we do minister
shakes.txt-70476-    To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you.  
--
--
shakes.txt-70763-    To this supposed, or else to let him suffer-
shakes.txt-70764-    What would you do?
shakes.txt-70765-  ISABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself;
shakes.txt:70766:    That is, were I under the terms of death,
shakes.txt-70767-    Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
--
shakes.txt-70767-    Th' impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies,
shakes.txt:70768:    And strip myself to death as to a bed
shakes.txt-70769-    That longing have been sick for, ere I'd yield
shakes.txt-70770-    My body up to shame.
shakes.txt-70771-  ANGELO. Then must your brother die.  
--
--
shakes.txt-70833-    Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
shakes.txt-70834-    That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
shakes.txt-70835-    By yielding up thy body to my will;
shakes.txt:70836:    Or else he must not only die the death,
shakes.txt:70837:    But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
shakes.txt-70838-    To ling'ring sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
shakes.txt-70839-    Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
shakes.txt-70840-    I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
--
--
shakes.txt-70855-    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
shakes.txt-70856-    More than our brother is our chastity.
shakes.txt-70857-    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
shakes.txt:70858:    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit
shakes.txt-70859-
shakes.txt-70860-
shakes.txt-70861-
--
--
shakes.txt-70880-  CLAUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine
shakes.txt-70881-    But only hope:
shakes.txt-70882-    I have hope to Eve, and am prepar'd to die.
shakes.txt:70883:  DUKE. Be absolute for death; either death or life
shakes.txt-70884-    Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life.
shakes.txt-70885-    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
shakes.txt-70886-    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
--
--
shakes.txt-70886-    That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art,
shakes.txt-70887-    Servile to all the skyey influences,
shakes.txt-70888-    That dost this habitation where thou keep'st
shakes.txt:70889:    Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art Death's fool;
shakes.txt-70890-    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
shakes.txt-70891-    And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
shakes.txt-70892-    For all th' accommodations that thou bear'st
--
--
shakes.txt-70894-    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
shakes.txt-70895-    Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,  
shakes.txt-70896-    And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
shakes.txt:70897:    Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
shakes.txt-70898-    For thou exists on many a thousand grains
shakes.txt-70899-    That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
shakes.txt-70900-    For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
--
--
shakes.txt-70903-    After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
shakes.txt-70904-    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
shakes.txt-70905-    Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
shakes.txt:70906:    And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
shakes.txt-70907-    For thine own bowels which do call thee sire,
shakes.txt-70908-    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
shakes.txt-70909-    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
--
--
shakes.txt-70915-    Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,  
shakes.txt-70916-    To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
shakes.txt-70917-    That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
shakes.txt:70918:    Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
shakes.txt-70919-    That makes these odds all even.
shakes.txt-70920-  CLAUDIO. I humbly thank you.
shakes.txt-70921-    To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
--
--
shakes.txt-70919-    That makes these odds all even.
shakes.txt-70920-  CLAUDIO. I humbly thank you.
shakes.txt-70921-    To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
shakes.txt:70922:    And, seeking death, find life. Let it come on.
shakes.txt-70923-  ISABELLA. [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
shakes.txt-70924-  PROVOST. Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
shakes.txt-70925-  DUKE. Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
--
--
shakes.txt-70948-  ISABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live:
shakes.txt-70949-    There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
shakes.txt-70950-    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
shakes.txt:70951:    But fetter you till death.
shakes.txt-70952-  CLAUDIO. Perpetual durance?
shakes.txt-70953-  ISABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
shakes.txt-70954-    Though all the world's vastidity you had,
--
--
shakes.txt-70962-    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
shakes.txt-70963-    And six or seven winters more respect
shakes.txt-70964-    Than a perpetual honour. Dar'st thou die?
shakes.txt:70965:    The sense of death is most in apprehension;
shakes.txt-70966-    And the poor beetle that we tread upon
shakes.txt-70967-    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
shakes.txt-70968-    As when a giant dies.
--
--
shakes.txt-70996-    I'd throw it down for your deliverance
shakes.txt-70997-    As frankly as a pin.
shakes.txt-70998-  CLAUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.
shakes.txt:70999:  ISABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
shakes.txt-71000-  CLAUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him
shakes.txt-71001-    That thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
shakes.txt-71002-    When he would force it? Sure it is no sin;
--
--
shakes.txt-71006-    Why would he for the momentary trick
shakes.txt-71007-    Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel!
shakes.txt-71008-  ISABELLA. What says my brother?
shakes.txt:71009:  CLAUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.
shakes.txt-71010-  ISABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.
shakes.txt-71011-  CLAUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
shakes.txt-71012-    To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
--
--
shakes.txt-71022-    The weariest and most loathed worldly life
shakes.txt-71023-    That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
shakes.txt-71024-    Can lay on nature is a paradise
shakes.txt:71025:    To what we fear of death.
shakes.txt-71026-  ISABELLA. Alas, alas!
shakes.txt-71027-  CLAUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live.
shakes.txt-71028-    What sin you do to save a brother's life,
--
--
shakes.txt-71038-    Ne'er issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance;
shakes.txt-71039-    Die; perish. Might but my bending down
shakes.txt-71040-    Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed.
shakes.txt:71041:    I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
shakes.txt-71042-    No word to save thee.
shakes.txt-71043-  CLAUDIO. Nay, hear me, Isabel.
shakes.txt-71044-  ISABELLA. O fie, fie, fie!
--
--
shakes.txt-71063-    disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her,
shakes.txt-71064-    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
shakes.txt-71065-    receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true;
shakes.txt:71066:    therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your
shakes.txt-71067-    resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die;
shakes.txt-71068-    go to your knees and make ready.
shakes.txt-71069-  CLAUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life
--
--
shakes.txt-71121-    of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which
shakes.txt-71122-    she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
shakes.txt-71123-    washed with them, but relents not.
shakes.txt:71124:  ISABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
shakes.txt-71125-    the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man
shakes.txt-71126-    live! But how out of this can she avail?
shakes.txt-71127-  DUKE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it
--
--
shakes.txt-71355-    with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother
shakes.txt-71356-    wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.
shakes.txt-71357-  PROVOST. So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd
shakes.txt:71358:    him for th' entertainment of death.
shakes.txt-71359-  ESCALUS. Good even, good father.
shakes.txt-71360-  DUKE. Bliss and goodness on you!
shakes.txt-71361-  ESCALUS. Of whence are you?
--
--
shakes.txt-71592-
shakes.txt-71593-                           Enter CLAUDIO
shakes.txt-71594-
shakes.txt:71595:    Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death;
shakes.txt-71596-    'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
shakes.txt-71597-    Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
shakes.txt-71598-  CLAUDIO. As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
--
--
shakes.txt-71687-  PROVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
shakes.txt-71688-  DUKE. Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to
shakes.txt-71689-    be touch'd?
shakes.txt:71690:  PROVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a  
shakes.txt-71691-    drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past,
shakes.txt-71692-    present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately
shakes.txt-71693-    mortal.
--
--
shakes.txt-71706-    days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and
shakes.txt-71707-    a dangerous courtesy.
shakes.txt-71708-  PROVOST. Pray, sir, in what?
shakes.txt:71709:  DUKE. In the delaying death.
shakes.txt-71710-  PROVOST. Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an  
shakes.txt-71711-    express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view
shakes.txt-71712-    of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the
--
--
shakes.txt-71715-    may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed,
shakes.txt-71716-    and his head borne to Angelo.
shakes.txt-71717-  PROVOST. Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
shakes.txt:71718:  DUKE. O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave
shakes.txt-71719-    the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
--
shakes.txt-71719-    the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the
shakes.txt:71720:    penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is
shakes.txt-71721-    common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
shakes.txt-71722-    good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against
shakes.txt-71723-    it with my life.
--
--
shakes.txt-71738-    anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within
shakes.txt-71739-    these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows
shakes.txt-71740-    not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour,
shakes.txt:71741:    perchance of the Duke's death, perchance entering into some
shakes.txt-71742-    monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th'
shakes.txt-71743-    unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into
shakes.txt-71744-    amazement how these things should be: all difficulties are but
--
--
shakes.txt-71782-  BARNARDINE. [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise
shakes.txt-71783-    there? What are you?
shakes.txt-71784-  POMPEY. Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir,
shakes.txt:71785:    to rise and be put to death.
shakes.txt-71786-  BARNARDINE. [ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.
shakes.txt-71787-  ABHORSON. Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
shakes.txt-71788-  POMPEY. Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and
--
--
shakes.txt-71827-                            Enter PROVOST
shakes.txt-71828-
shakes.txt-71829-  PROVOST. Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
shakes.txt:71830:  DUKE. A creature unprepar'd, unmeet for death;
shakes.txt-71831-    And to transport him in the mind he is
shakes.txt-71832-    Were damnable.
shakes.txt-71833-  PROVOST. Here in the prison, father,
--
--
shakes.txt-72472-    Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,
shakes.txt-72473-    No longer session hold upon my shame,
shakes.txt-72474-    But let my trial be mine own confession;
shakes.txt:72475:    Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,
shakes.txt-72476-    Is all the grace I beg.
shakes.txt-72477-  DUKE. Come hither, Mariana.
shakes.txt-72478-    Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
--
--
shakes.txt-72493-    Your unknown sovereignty.
shakes.txt-72494-  DUKE. You are pardon'd, Isabel.
shakes.txt-72495-    And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
shakes.txt:72496:    Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
shakes.txt-72497-    And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
shakes.txt-72498-    Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
shakes.txt-72499-    Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
--
--
shakes.txt-72498-    Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
shakes.txt-72499-    Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
shakes.txt-72500-    Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
shakes.txt:72501:    It was the swift celerity of his death,
shakes.txt-72502-    Which I did think with slower foot came on,
shakes.txt-72503-    That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
--
shakes.txt-72502-    Which I did think with slower foot came on,
shakes.txt-72503-    That brain'd my purpose. But peace be with him!
shakes.txt:72504:    That life is better life, past fearing death,
shakes.txt-72505-    Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort,
shakes.txt-72506-    So happy is your brother.  
shakes.txt-72507-  ISABELLA. I do, my lord.
--
--
shakes.txt-72517-    Thereon dependent, for your brother's life-
shakes.txt-72518-    The very mercy of the law cries out
shakes.txt-72519-    Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
shakes.txt:72520:    'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
shakes.txt-72521-    Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
shakes.txt-72522-    Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.
shakes.txt-72523-    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,

shakes.txt-72523-    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested,
shakes.txt-72524-    Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
shakes.txt-72525-    We do condemn thee to the very block
shakes.txt:72526:    Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.  
shakes.txt-72527-    Away with him!
shakes.txt-72528-  MARIANA. O my most gracious lord,
shakes.txt-72529-    I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
--
--
shakes.txt-72540-  DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive.
shakes.txt-72541-  MARIANA. Gentle my liege-                           [Kneeling]
shakes.txt-72542-  DUKE. You do but lose your labour.
shakes.txt:72543:    Away with him to death! [To LUCIO] Now, sir, to you.
shakes.txt-72544-  MARIANA. O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
shakes.txt-72545-    Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
shakes.txt-72546-    I'll lend you all my life to do you service.  
--
--
shakes.txt-72555-    And, for the most, become much more the better
shakes.txt-72556-    For being a little bad; so may my husband.
shakes.txt-72557-    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
shakes.txt:72558:  DUKE. He dies for Claudio's death.
shakes.txt-72559-  ISABELLA. [Kneeling] Most bounteous sir,
shakes.txt-72560-    Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
shakes.txt-72561-    As if my brother liv'd. I partly think
--
--
shakes.txt-72594-    And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
shakes.txt-72595-  ANGELO. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure;
shakes.txt-72596-    And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
shakes.txt:72597:    That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
shakes.txt-72598-    'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
shakes.txt-72599-

shakes.txt-72644-    Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
shakes.txt-72645-    Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
shakes.txt-72646-    And see our pleasure herein executed.  
shakes.txt:72647:  LUCIO. Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping,
shakes.txt-72648-    and hanging.
shakes.txt-72649-  DUKE. Slandering a prince deserves it.
shakes.txt-72650-                                      Exeunt OFFICERS with LUCIO
--

shakes.txt-72963-    choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a
shakes.txt-72964-    living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father. Is it not
shakes.txt-72965-    hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
shakes.txt:72966:  NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death
shakes.txt-72967-    have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath
shakes.txt-72968-    devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof
shakes.txt-72969-    who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be
--
--
shakes.txt-72983-    not have me, choose.' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear
shakes.txt-72984-    he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so
shakes.txt-72985-    full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married
shakes.txt:72986:    to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of
shakes.txt-72987-    these. God defend me from these two!
shakes.txt-72988-  NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
shakes.txt-72989-  PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In
--
--
shakes.txt-73840-  PORTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
shakes.txt-73841-    Then I am yours.                [He opens the golden casket]
shakes.txt-73842-  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?
shakes.txt:73843:    A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
shakes.txt-73844-    There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
shakes.txt-73845-         'All that glisters is not gold,
shakes.txt-73846-         Often have you heard that told;

shakes.txt-74072-    carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my
shakes.txt-74073-    gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
shakes.txt-74074-  SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd
shakes.txt:74075:    ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a
shakes.txt-74076-    third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or
shakes.txt-74077-    crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
shakes.txt-74078-    honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his name

shakes.txt-74236-    Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
shakes.txt-74237-    Fading in music. That the comparison
shakes.txt-74238-    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
shakes.txt:74239:    And wat'ry death-bed for him. He may win;
shakes.txt-74240-    And what is music then? Then music is
shakes.txt-74241-    Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
shakes.txt-74242-    To a new-crowned monarch; such it is
--
--
shakes.txt-74525-    my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the
shakes.txt-74526-    Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I  
shakes.txt-74527-    should live, all debts are clear'd between you and I, if I might
shakes.txt:74528:    but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if
shakes.txt-74529-    your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.'
shakes.txt-74530-  PORTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
shakes.txt-74531-  BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away,
--
--
shakes.txt-74900-    The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
shakes.txt-74901-    Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
shakes.txt-74902-  ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
shakes.txt:74903:    Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit
shakes.txt-74904-    Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
shakes.txt-74905-    You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
shakes.txt-74906-    Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.

shakes.txt-75054-    The flesh?
shakes.txt-75055-  SHYLOCK. I have them ready.
shakes.txt-75056-  PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
shakes.txt:75057:    To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
shakes.txt-75058-  SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?
shakes.txt-75059-  PORTIA. It is not so express'd, but what of that?  
shakes.txt-75060-    'Twere good you do so much for charity.
--
--
shakes.txt-75071-    Of such misery doth she cut me off.
shakes.txt-75072-    Commend me to your honourable wife;
shakes.txt-75073-    Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
shakes.txt:75074:    Say how I lov'd you; speak me fair in death;
shakes.txt-75075-    And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
shakes.txt-75076-    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
shakes.txt-75077-    Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,

shakes.txt-75184-    To quit the fine for one half of his goods;
shakes.txt-75185-    I am content, so he will let me have
shakes.txt-75186-    The other half in use, to render it
shakes.txt:75187:    Upon his death unto the gentleman
shakes.txt-75188-    That lately stole his daughter-
shakes.txt-75189-    Two things provided more; that, for this favour,
shakes.txt-75190-    He presently become a Christian;
--
--
shakes.txt-75485-    Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
shakes.txt-75486-  NERISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?
shakes.txt-75487-    You swore to me, when I did give it you,  
shakes.txt:75488:    That you would wear it till your hour of death,
shakes.txt-75489-    And that it should lie with you in your grave;
shakes.txt-75490-    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
shakes.txt-75491-    You should have been respective and have kept it.
--
--
shakes.txt-75632-  NERISSA. Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
shakes.txt-75633-    There do I give to you and Jessica,
shakes.txt-75634-    From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
shakes.txt:75635:    After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
shakes.txt-75636-  LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
shakes.txt-75637-    Of starved people.
shakes.txt-75638-  PORTIA. It is almost morning,

shakes.txt-75777-    speaks small like a woman.
shakes.txt-75778-  EVANS. It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you
shakes.txt-75779-    will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and
shakes.txt:75780:    gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death's-bed-Got

shakes.txt-75782-    overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we
shakes.txt-75783-    leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage
--
--
shakes.txt-77595-  MRS. PAGE. I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
shakes.txt-77596-  QUICKLY. That's my master, Master Doctor.
shakes.txt-77597-  ANNE. Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth.
shakes.txt:77598:    And bowl'd to death with turnips.  
shakes.txt-77599-  MRS. PAGE. Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master
shakes.txt-77600-    Fenton,
shakes.txt-77601-    I will not be your friend, nor enemy;
--
--
shakes.txt-77643-    i' th' litter; and you may know by my size that I have
shakes.txt-77644-    a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as deep as
shakes.txt-77645-    hell I should down. I had been drown'd but that the shore
shakes.txt:77646:    was shelvy and shallow-a death that I abhor; for the water
shakes.txt-77647-    swells a man; and what a thing should I have been when
shakes.txt-77648-    had been swell'd! I should have been a mountain of  
shakes.txt-77649-    mummy.
--
--
shakes.txt-77734-    search'd it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold,
shakes.txt-77735-    held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away
shakes.txt-77736-    went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master
shakes.txt:77737:    Brook-I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first,
shakes.txt-77738-    an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
shakes.txt-77739-    bell-wether; next, to be compass'd like a good bilbo in the
shakes.txt-77740-    circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and
--
--
shakes.txt-78026-    intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
shakes.txt-78027-    Pluck me out all the linen.
shakes.txt-78028-  MRS. FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's
shakes.txt:78029:    death.
shakes.txt-78030-  PAGE. Here's no man.
shakes.txt-78031-  SHALLOW. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
shakes.txt-78032-    wrongs you.
--
--
shakes.txt-78447-  FALSTAFF. Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll, hold. This is
shakes.txt-78448-    the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers.
shakes.txt-78449-    Away, go; they say there is divinity in odd numbers, either
shakes.txt:78450:    in nativity, chance, or death. Away.
shakes.txt-78451-  QUICKLY. I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do what I can to
shakes.txt-78452-    get you a pair of horns.
shakes.txt-78453-  FALSTAFF. Away, I say; time wears; hold up your head, and
--
--
shakes.txt-78945-    I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
shakes.txt-78946-    As she is mine I may dispose of her;
shakes.txt-78947-    Which shall be either to this gentleman
shakes.txt:78948:    Or to her death, according to our law
shakes.txt-78949-    Immediately provided in that case.
shakes.txt-78950-  THESEUS. What say you, Hermia? Be advis'd, fair maid.
shakes.txt-78951-    To you your father should be as a god;
--
--
shakes.txt-78967-    But I beseech your Grace that I may know
shakes.txt-78968-    The worst that may befall me in this case,
shakes.txt-78969-    If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
shakes.txt:78970:  THESEUS. Either to die the death, or to abjure
shakes.txt-78971-    For ever the society of men.
shakes.txt-78972-    Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
shakes.txt-78973-    Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
--
--
shakes.txt-79023-    To fit your fancies to your father's will,
shakes.txt-79024-    Or else the law of Athens yields you up-
shakes.txt-79025-    Which by no means we may extenuate-
shakes.txt:79026:    To death, or to a vow of single life.
shakes.txt-79027-    Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?
shakes.txt-79028-    Demetrius, and Egeus, go along;
shakes.txt-79029-    I must employ you in some business
--
--
shakes.txt-79045-  LYSANDER. Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
shakes.txt-79046-  HERMIA. O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
shakes.txt-79047-  LYSANDER. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
shakes.txt:79048:    War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,
shakes.txt-79049-    Making it momentary as a sound,
shakes.txt-79050-    Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
shakes.txt-79051-    Brief as the lightning in the collied night
--
--
shakes.txt-79177-  BOTTOM. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then
shakes.txt-79178-    read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
shakes.txt-79179-  QUINCE. Marry, our play is 'The most Lamentable Comedy and most
shakes.txt:79180:    Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby.'
shakes.txt-79181-  BOTTOM. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now,
shakes.txt-79182-    good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters,
shakes.txt-79183-    spread yourselves.
--
--
shakes.txt-79747-    Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
shakes.txt-79748-    Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
shakes.txt-79749-    No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.
shakes.txt:79750:    Either death or you I'll find immediately.              Exit
shakes.txt-79751-
shakes.txt-79752-
shakes.txt-79753-

shakes.txt-80156-    And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
shakes.txt-80157-    In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
shakes.txt-80158-    And yours of Helena to me bequeath,  
shakes.txt:80159:    Whom I do love and will do till my death.
shakes.txt-80160-  HELENA. Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
shakes.txt-80161-  DEMETRIUS. Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.
shakes.txt-80162-    If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
--
--
shakes.txt-80237-    If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
shakes.txt-80238-    You would not make me such an argument.  
shakes.txt-80239-    But fare ye well; 'tis partly my own fault,
shakes.txt:80240:    Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.
shakes.txt-80241-  LYSANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
shakes.txt-80242-    My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
shakes.txt-80243-  HELENA. O excellent!
--
--
shakes.txt-80371-    Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
shakes.txt-80372-    And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
shakes.txt-80373-    And from each other look thou lead them thus,
shakes.txt:80374:    Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
shakes.txt-80375-    With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
shakes.txt-80376-    Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
shakes.txt-80377-    Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
--
--
shakes.txt-80380-    When they next wake, all this derision
shakes.txt-80381-    Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
shakes.txt-80382-    And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
shakes.txt:80383:    With league whose date till death shall never end.
shakes.txt-80384-    Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
shakes.txt-80385-    I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;
shakes.txt-80386-    And then I will her charmed eye release

shakes.txt-80748-    be call'd 'Bottom's Dream,' because it hath no bottom; and I will
shakes.txt-80749-    sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.
shakes.txt-80750-    Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at

shakes.txt-80878-    That is an old device, and it was play'd  
shakes.txt-80879-    When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
shakes.txt:80880:    'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
shakes.txt-80881-    Of Learning, late deceas'd in beggary.'
shakes.txt-80882-    That is some satire, keen and critical,
shakes.txt-80883-    Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
--

shakes.txt-81046-  PYRAMUS. O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
shakes.txt-81047-  THISBY. I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
shakes.txt-81048-  PYRAMUS. Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
shakes.txt:81049:  THISBY. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.
shakes.txt-81050-                                       Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY
shakes.txt-81051-  WALL. Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;

shakes.txt-81131-             O Fates! come, come;
shakes.txt-81132-             Cut thread and thrum;
shakes.txt-81133-           Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.
shakes.txt:81134:  THESEUS. This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go
shakes.txt-81135-    near to make a man look sad.
shakes.txt-81136-  HIPPOLYTA. Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
shakes.txt-81137-  PYRAMUS. O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?

shakes.txt-81734-    displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my
shakes.txt-81735-    overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.
shakes.txt-81736-    You are both sure, and will assist me?
shakes.txt:81737:  Con. To the death, my lord.
shakes.txt-81738-  John. Let us to the great supper. Their cheer is the greater that  
shakes.txt-81739-    I am subdued. Would the cook were o' my mind! Shall we go prove
shakes.txt-81740-    what's to be done?
--
--
shakes.txt-82119-  John. I remember.
shakes.txt-82120-  Bora. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her
shakes.txt-82121-    to look out at her lady's chamber window.
shakes.txt:82122:  John. What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
shakes.txt-82123-  Bora. The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the  
shakes.txt-82124-    Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
shakes.txt-82125-    his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio (whose estimation do

shakes.txt-82511-    But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
shakes.txt-82512-    She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
shakes.txt:82513:    Out of myself, press me to death with wit!
shakes.txt-82514-    Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
shakes.txt-82515-    Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
--
shakes.txt-82514-    Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
shakes.txt-82515-    Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
shakes.txt:82516:    It were a better death than die with mocks,
shakes.txt-82517-    Which is as bad as die with tickling.
shakes.txt-82518-  Urs. Yet tell her of it. Hear what she will say.
shakes.txt-82519-  Hero. No; rather I will go to Benedick

shakes.txt-83138-  Leon. O Fate, take not away thy heavy hand!
shakes.txt:83139:    Death is the fairest cover for her shame
shakes.txt-83140-    That may be wish'd for.
shakes.txt-83141-  Beat. How now, cousin Hero?
shakes.txt-83142-  Friar. Have comfort, lady.

shakes.txt-83209-    At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
shakes.txt-83210-    Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
shakes.txt:83211:    Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
shakes.txt-83212-  Friar. There is some strange misprision in the princes.
shakes.txt-83213-  Bene. Two of them have the very bent of honour;
shakes.txt-83214-    And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
--
--
shakes.txt-83263-    Will fashion the event in better shape
shakes.txt-83264-    Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
shakes.txt-83265-    But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
shakes.txt:83266:    The supposition of the lady's death
shakes.txt-83267-    Will quench the wonder of her infamy.
shakes.txt-83268-    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
shakes.txt-83269-    As best befits her wounded reputation,
--
--
shakes.txt-83555-    Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
shakes.txt-83556-  Leon. Brother--
shakes.txt-83557-  Ant. Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece,  
shakes.txt:83558:    And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
shakes.txt-83559-    That dare as well answer a man indeed
shakes.txt-83560-    As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
shakes.txt-83561-    Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
--
--
shakes.txt-83572-  Ant. Come, 'tis no matter.
shakes.txt-83573-    Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
shakes.txt-83574-  Pedro. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
shakes.txt:83575:    My heart is sorry for your daughter's death;
shakes.txt-83576-    But, on my honour, she was charg'd with nothing
shakes.txt-83577-    But what was true, and very full of proof.  
shakes.txt-83578-  Leon. My lord, my lord--
--
--
shakes.txt-83616-  Bene. [aside to Claudio] You are a villain. I jest not; I will make
shakes.txt-83617-    it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do  
shakes.txt-83618-    me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have kill'd a
shakes.txt:83619:    sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear
shakes.txt-83620-    from you.
shakes.txt-83621-  Claud. Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
shakes.txt-83622-  Pedro. What, a feast, a feast?
--
--
shakes.txt-83694-    slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and
shakes.txt-83695-    saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments; how you disgrac'd her
shakes.txt-83696-    when you should marry her. My villany they have upon record,
shakes.txt:83697:    which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my  
shakes.txt-83698-    shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false
shakes.txt-83699-    accusation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a
shakes.txt-83700-    villain.
--
--
shakes.txt-83724-  Leon. No, not so, villain! thou beliest thyself.
shakes.txt-83725-    Here stand a pair of honourable men--
shakes.txt-83726-    A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
shakes.txt:83727:    I thank you princes for my daughter's death.
shakes.txt-83728-    Record it with your high and worthy deeds.
shakes.txt-83729-    'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
shakes.txt-83730-  Claud. I know not how to pray your patience;

shakes.txt-83907-
shakes.txt-83908-                      Epitaph.
shakes.txt-83909-
shakes.txt:83910:        Done to death by slanderous tongues
shakes.txt-83911-          Was the Hero that here lies.
--
shakes.txt-83911-          Was the Hero that here lies.
shakes.txt:83912:        Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
shakes.txt-83913-          Gives her fame which never dies.
shakes.txt-83914-        So the life that died with shame
--
shakes.txt-83913-          Gives her fame which never dies.
shakes.txt-83914-        So the life that died with shame
shakes.txt:83915:        Lives in death with glorious fame.
shakes.txt-83916-
shakes.txt-83917-    Hang thou there upon the tomb,
shakes.txt-83918-                                          [Hangs up the scroll.]
--
--
shakes.txt-83929-        Help us to sigh and groan
shakes.txt-83930-          Heavily, heavily,
shakes.txt-83931-        Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
shakes.txt:83932:        Till death be uttered
shakes.txt-83933-          Heavily, heavily.
shakes.txt-83934-
shakes.txt-83935-  Claud. Now unto thy bones good night!
--
--
shakes.txt-84033-  Leon. She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv'd.
shakes.txt-84034-  Friar. All this amazement can I qualify,
shakes.txt-84035-    When, after that the holy rites are ended,
shakes.txt:84036:    I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death.
shakes.txt-84037-    Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
shakes.txt-84038-    And to the chapel let us presently.
shakes.txt-84039-  Bene. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
--
--
shakes.txt-84850-  IAGO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
shakes.txt-84851-    Why, thou silly gentleman!
shakes.txt-84852-  RODERIGO. It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then
shakes.txt:84853:    have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
shakes.txt-84854-  IAGO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times
shakes.txt-84855-    seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
shakes.txt-84856-    an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I
--
--
shakes.txt-85011-  MONTANO. I she well shipp'd?  
shakes.txt-85012-  CASSIO. His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
shakes.txt-85013-    Of very expert and approved allowance;
shakes.txt:85014:    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
shakes.txt-85015-    Stand in bold cure.
shakes.txt-85016-                              A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
shakes.txt-85017-
--
--
shakes.txt-85169-  OTHELLO. It gives me wonder great as my content
shakes.txt-85170-    To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
shakes.txt-85171-    If after every tempest come such calms,  
shakes.txt:85172:    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
shakes.txt-85173-    And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
shakes.txt-85174-    Olympus-high, and duck again as low
shakes.txt-85175-    As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
--
--
shakes.txt-85492-                   Re-enter Othello and Attendants.
shakes.txt-85493-
shakes.txt-85494-  OTHELLO.                      What is the matter here?
shakes.txt:85495:  MONTANO. 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
shakes.txt-85496-   Faints.  
shakes.txt-85497-  OTHELLO. Hold, for your lives!
shakes.txt-85498-  IAGO. Hold, ho! Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen-
--
--
shakes.txt-86143-    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
shakes.txt-86144-    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones:
shakes.txt-86145-    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
shakes.txt:86146:    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
shakes.txt-86147-    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
shakes.txt-86148-    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
shakes.txt-86149-
--
--
shakes.txt-86289-  IAGO. And may. But, how? how satisfied, my lord?
shakes.txt-86290-    Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?
shakes.txt-86291-    Behold her topp'd?
shakes.txt:86292:  OTHELLO.             Death and damnation! O!
shakes.txt-86293-  IAGO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
shakes.txt-86294-    To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,  
shakes.txt-86295-    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
--
--
shakes.txt-86377-    But let her live.
shakes.txt-86378-  OTHELLO.            Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
shakes.txt-86379-    Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
shakes.txt:86380:    To furnish me with some swift means of death
shakes.txt-86381-    For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
shakes.txt-86382-  IAGO. I am your own forever.                                Exeunt.
shakes.txt-86383-
--
--
shakes.txt-87237-    one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second
shakes.txt-87238-    your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not
shakes.txt-87239-    amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a
shakes.txt:87240:    necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
shakes.txt-87241-    it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to
shakes.txt-87242-    waste. About it.
shakes.txt-87243-  RODERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.
--
--
shakes.txt-87451-  LODOVICO. Two or three groan; it is a heavy night.
shakes.txt-87452-    These may be counterfeits; let's think't unsafe
shakes.txt-87453-    To come in to the cry without more help.
shakes.txt:87454:  RODERIGO. Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
shakes.txt-87455-  LODOVICO. Hark!
shakes.txt-87456-
shakes.txt-87457-                     Re-enter Iago, with a light.
--
--
shakes.txt-87612-  OTHELLO. Think on thy sins.
shakes.txt-87613-  DESDEMONA.                  They are loves I bear to you.
shakes.txt-87614-  OTHELLO. Ay, and for that thou diest.
shakes.txt:87615:  DESDEMONA. That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
shakes.txt-87616-    Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
shakes.txt-87617-    Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
shakes.txt-87618-    These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
--
--
shakes.txt-87624-  DESDEMONA.               No, by my life and soul!
shakes.txt-87625-    Send for the man, and ask him.  
shakes.txt-87626-  OTHELLO.                         Sweet soul, take heed,
shakes.txt:87627:    Take heed of perjury; thou are on thy deathbed.
shakes.txt-87628-  DESDEMONA. Ay, but not yet to die.
shakes.txt-87629-  OTHELLO.                           Yes, presently:
shakes.txt-87630-    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin,
--
--
shakes.txt-87675-  OTHELLO.                                      Who's there?
shakes.txt-87676-  EMILIA. [Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
shakes.txt-87677-  OTHELLO. Yes, 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
shakes.txt:87678:    'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
shakes.txt-87679-    The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
shakes.txt-87680-    Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?
shakes.txt-87681-    I think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?
--
--
shakes.txt-87713-  EMILIA. Out, and alas! That was my lady's voice.
shakes.txt-87714-    Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
shakes.txt-87715-    Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!
shakes.txt:87716:  DESDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.
shakes.txt-87717-  EMILIA. O, who hath done this deed?
shakes.txt-87718-  DESDEMONA. Nobody; I myself. Farewell;
shakes.txt-87719-    Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!                    Dies.
--
--
shakes.txt-87922-    An honorable murtherer, if you will,
shakes.txt-87923-    For nought did I in hate, but all in honor.
shakes.txt-87924-  LODOVICO. This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy.
shakes.txt:87925:    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?  
shakes.txt-87926-  OTHELLO. Ay.
shakes.txt-87927-  CASSIO. Dear general, I never gave you cause.
shakes.txt-87928-  OTHELLO. I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
--
--
shakes.txt-87937-    Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
shakes.txt-87938-    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
shakes.txt-87939-    And here another. The one of them imports
shakes.txt:87940:    The death of Cassio to be undertook
shakes.txt-87941-    By Roderigo.
shakes.txt-87942-  OTHELLO. O villain!
shakes.txt-87943-  CASSIO.             Most heathenish and most gross!
--
--
shakes.txt-88191-    Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
shakes.txt-88192-    Further I say, and further will maintain
shakes.txt-88193-    Upon his bad life to make all this good,
shakes.txt:88194:    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
shakes.txt-88195-    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
shakes.txt-88196-    And consequently, like a traitor coward,
shakes.txt-88197-    Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood;
--
--
shakes.txt-88223-    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
shakes.txt-88224-    Upon remainder of a dear account
shakes.txt-88225-    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
shakes.txt:88226:    Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death-
shakes.txt-88227-    I slew him not, but to my own disgrace  
shakes.txt-88228-    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
shakes.txt-88229-    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
--
--
shakes.txt-88261-  MOWBRAY. Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot;
shakes.txt-88262-    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
shakes.txt-88263-    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
shakes.txt:88264:    Despite of death, that lives upon my grave
shakes.txt-88265-    To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
shakes.txt-88266-    I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffl'd here;
shakes.txt-88267-    Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,  
--
--
shakes.txt-88335-    That mettle, that self mould, that fashion'd thee,
shakes.txt-88336-    Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
shakes.txt-88337-    Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent
shakes.txt:88338:    In some large measure to thy father's death
shakes.txt-88339-    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
shakes.txt-88340-    Who was the model of thy father's life.
shakes.txt-88341-    Call it not patience, Gaunt-it is despair;
--
--
shakes.txt-88345-    That which in mean men we entitle patience
shakes.txt-88346-    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
shakes.txt-88347-    What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life
shakes.txt:88348:    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
shakes.txt-88349-  GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,  
shakes.txt-88350-    His deputy anointed in His sight,
--
shakes.txt-88349-  GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,  
shakes.txt-88350-    His deputy anointed in His sight,
shakes.txt:88351:    Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully,
shakes.txt-88352-    Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
shakes.txt-88353-    An angry arm against His minister.
shakes.txt-88354-  DUCHESS. Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
--
--
shakes.txt-88444-    That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
shakes.txt-88445-    To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.
shakes.txt-88446-    And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
shakes.txt:88447:  MARSHAL. On pain of death, no person be so bold
shakes.txt-88448-    Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
shakes.txt-88449-    Except the Marshal and such officers
shakes.txt-88450-    Appointed to direct these fair designs.
--
--
shakes.txt-88467-    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
shakes.txt-88468-    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
shakes.txt-88469-    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
shakes.txt:88470:    Not sick, although I have to do with death,
shakes.txt-88471-    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
shakes.txt-88472-    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet  
shakes.txt-88473-    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.
--
--
shakes.txt-88579-    Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
shakes.txt-88580-    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
shakes.txt-88581-    Too far in years to be a pupil now.
shakes.txt:88582:    What is thy sentence, then, but speechless death,
shakes.txt-88583-    Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
shakes.txt-88584-  KING RICHARD. It boots thee not to be compassionate;
shakes.txt-88585-    After our sentence plaining comes too late.
--
--
shakes.txt-88631-    My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
shakes.txt-88632-    Shall be extinct with age and endless night;  
shakes.txt-88633-    My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
shakes.txt:88634:    And blindfold death not let me see my son.
shakes.txt-88635-  KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.
shakes.txt-88636-  GAUNT. But not a minute, King, that thou canst give:
shakes.txt-88637-    Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
--
--
shakes.txt-88638-    And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
shakes.txt-88639-    Thou can'st help time to furrow me with age,
shakes.txt-88640-    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
shakes.txt:88641:    Thy word is current with him for my death,
shakes.txt-88642-    But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
shakes.txt-88643-  KING RICHARD. Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
shakes.txt-88644-    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.
--
--
shakes.txt-88831-    As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
shakes.txt-88832-    Writ in remembrance more than things long past.
shakes.txt-88833-    Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
shakes.txt:88834:    My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
shakes.txt-88835-  YORK. No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,  
shakes.txt-88836-    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
shakes.txt-88837-    Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
--
--
shakes.txt-88883-    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
shakes.txt-88884-    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
shakes.txt-88885-    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
shakes.txt:88886:    How happy then were my ensuing death!
shakes.txt-88887-
shakes.txt-88888-    Enter KING and QUEEN, AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT,
shakes.txt-88889-                Ross, and WILLOUGHBY
--
--
shakes.txt-88914-  KING RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
shakes.txt-88915-  GAUNT. Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;  
shakes.txt-88916-    Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
shakes.txt:88917:    Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
shakes.txt-88918-    Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
shakes.txt-88919-    And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
shakes.txt-88920-    Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
--
--
shakes.txt-88977-    His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
shakes.txt-88978-    Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
shakes.txt-88979-  YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
shakes.txt:88980:    Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
shakes.txt-88981-  KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
shakes.txt-88982-    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
shakes.txt-88983-    So much for that. Now for our Irish wars.
--
--
shakes.txt-88990-    Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.
shakes.txt-88991-  YORK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
shakes.txt-88992-    Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
shakes.txt:88993:    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,
shakes.txt-88994-    Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
shakes.txt-88995-    Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke  
shakes.txt-88996-    About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
--
--
shakes.txt-89098-  ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
shakes.txt-89099-    And unavoided is the danger now
shakes.txt-89100-    For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
shakes.txt:89101:  NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
shakes.txt-89102-    I spy life peering; but I dare not say
shakes.txt-89103-    How near the tidings of our comfort is.
shakes.txt-89104-  WILLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
--
--
shakes.txt-89212-  QUEEN. Who shall hinder me?
shakes.txt-89213-    I will despair, and be at enmity
shakes.txt-89214-    With cozening hope-he is a flatterer,
shakes.txt:89215:    A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
shakes.txt-89216-    Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
shakes.txt-89217-    Which false hope lingers in extremity.  
shakes.txt-89218-
--
--
shakes.txt-89517-    Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap-
shakes.txt-89518-    The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
shakes.txt-89519-    The other to enjoy by rage and war.
shakes.txt:89520:    These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
shakes.txt-89521-    Farewell. Our countrymen are gone and fled,
shakes.txt-89522-    As well assur'd Richard their King is dead.             Exit  
shakes.txt-89523-  SALISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,
--
--
shakes.txt-89554-    With too much urging your pernicious lives,
shakes.txt-89555-    For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
shakes.txt-89556-    From off my hands, here in the view of men
shakes.txt:89557:    I will unfold some causes of your deaths:
shakes.txt-89558-    You have misled a prince, a royal king,
shakes.txt-89559-    A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
shakes.txt-89560-    By you unhappied and disfigured clean;
--
--
shakes.txt-89576-    Save men's opinions and my living blood
shakes.txt-89577-    To show the world I am a gentleman.
shakes.txt-89578-    This and much more, much more than twice all this,
shakes.txt:89579:    Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over
shakes.txt:89580:    To execution and the hand of death.
shakes.txt:89581:  BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me
shakes.txt-89582-    Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
shakes.txt-89583-  GREEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,
shakes.txt-89584-    And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
--
--
shakes.txt-89624-    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
shakes.txt-89625-    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,
shakes.txt-89626-    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
shakes.txt:89627:    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
shakes.txt-89628-    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.
shakes.txt-89629-    This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones
shakes.txt-89630-    Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
--
--
shakes.txt-89711-    Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend;
shakes.txt-89712-    They break their faith to God as well as us.
shakes.txt-89713-    Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay-
shakes.txt:89714:    The worst is death, and death will have his day.
shakes.txt-89715-  SCROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd
shakes.txt-89716-    To bear the tidings of calamity.
shakes.txt-89717-    Like an unseasonable stormy day
--
--
shakes.txt-89747-    Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
shakes.txt-89748-    Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
shakes.txt-89749-    With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
shakes.txt:89750:    Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
shakes.txt-89751-    And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.
shakes.txt-89752-  AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
shakes.txt-89753-  SCROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
--
--
shakes.txt-89760-    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath
shakes.txt-89761-    Save our deposed bodies to the ground?  
shakes.txt-89762-    Our lands, our lives, and an, are Bolingbroke's.
shakes.txt:89763:    And nothing can we can our own but death
shakes.txt-89764-    And that small model of the barren earth
shakes.txt-89765-    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
shakes.txt-89766-    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground
--
--
shakes.txt-89764-    And that small model of the barren earth
shakes.txt-89765-    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
shakes.txt-89766-    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground
shakes.txt:89767:    And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
shakes.txt-89768-    How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,
shakes.txt-89769-    Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,
shakes.txt-89770-    Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,
--
--
shakes.txt-89770-    Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,
shakes.txt-89771-    All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
shakes.txt-89772-    That rounds the mortal temples of a king
shakes.txt:89773:    Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,
shakes.txt-89774-    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;
shakes.txt-89775-    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
shakes.txt-89776-    To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;
--
--
shakes.txt-89792-    Gives, in your weakness, strength unto your foe,
shakes.txt-89793-    And so your follies fight against yourself.
shakes.txt-89794-    Fear and be slain-no worse can come to fight;
shakes.txt:89795:    And fight and die is death destroying death,
shakes.txt:89796:    Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
shakes.txt-89797-  AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
shakes.txt-89798-    And learn to make a body of a limb.
shakes.txt-89799-  KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come
--
--
shakes.txt-90155-    'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
shakes.txt-90156-    To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's
shakes.txt-90157-    That tell black tidings.
shakes.txt:90158:  QUEEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
shakes.txt-90159-                                                [Coming forward]
shakes.txt-90160-    Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
shakes.txt-90161-    How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
--
--
shakes.txt-90217-
shakes.txt-90218-  BOLINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.
shakes.txt-90219-    Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind-
shakes.txt:90220:    What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death;
shakes.txt-90221-    Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd
shakes.txt-90222-    The bloody office of his timeless end.
shakes.txt-90223-  BAGOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
--
--
shakes.txt-90224-  BOLINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
shakes.txt-90225-  BAGOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
shakes.txt-90226-    Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
shakes.txt:90227:    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted
shakes.txt-90228-    I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length,
shakes.txt-90229-    That reacheth from the restful English Court
shakes.txt-90230-    As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
--
--
shakes.txt-90233-    The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
shakes.txt-90234-    Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
shakes.txt-90235-    Adding withal, how blest this land would be
shakes.txt:90236:    In this your cousin's death.
shakes.txt-90237-  AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
shakes.txt-90238-    What answer shall I make to this base man?
shakes.txt-90239-    Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
--
--
shakes.txt-90240-    On equal terms to give him chastisement?
shakes.txt-90241-    Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
shakes.txt-90242-    With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
shakes.txt:90243:    There is my gage, the manual seal of death
shakes.txt-90244-    That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,
shakes.txt-90245-    And will maintain what thou hast said is false
shakes.txt-90246-    In thy heart-blood, through being all too base
--
--
shakes.txt-90252-    There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.
shakes.txt-90253-    By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
shakes.txt-90254-    I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it,
shakes.txt:90255:    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
shakes.txt-90256-    If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest;
shakes.txt-90257-    And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
shakes.txt-90258-    Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
--
--
shakes.txt-90615-    From which awak'd, the truth of what we are
shakes.txt-90616-    Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
shakes.txt-90617-    To grim Necessity; and he and
shakes.txt:90618:    Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,
shakes.txt-90619-    And cloister thee in some religious house.
shakes.txt-90620-    Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
shakes.txt-90621-    Which our profane hours here have thrown down.
--
--
shakes.txt-90632-    I had been still a happy king of men.
shakes.txt-90633-    Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.
shakes.txt-90634-    Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest,
shakes.txt:90635:    As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
shakes.txt-90636-    In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
shakes.txt-90637-    With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales
shakes.txt-90638-    Of woeful ages long ago betid;
--
--
shakes.txt-90664-    To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
shakes.txt-90665-    The love of wicked men converts to fear;
shakes.txt-90666-    That fear to hate; and hate turns one or both
shakes.txt:90667:    To worthy danger and deserved death.
shakes.txt-90668-  NORTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
shakes.txt-90669-    Take leave, and part; for you must part forthwith.
shakes.txt-90670-  KING RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate  
--
--
shakes.txt-90937-    Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
shakes.txt-90938-    Or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies.
shakes.txt-90939-    Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
shakes.txt:90940:    The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
shakes.txt-90941-  DUCHESS. [Within] I What ho, my liege, for God's sake, let me in.
shakes.txt-90942-  BOLINGBROKE. What shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry?
shakes.txt-90943-  DUCHESS. [Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I.
--
--
shakes.txt-91167-                                           [Beats the KEEPER]
shakes.txt-91168-  KEEPER. Help, help, help!
shakes.txt-91169-    The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed
shakes.txt:91170:  KING RICHARD. How now! What means death in this rude assault?
shakes.txt:91171:    Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.  
shakes.txt-91172-                         [Snatching a weapon and killing one]
shakes.txt-91173-    Go thou and fill another room in hell.
shakes.txt-91174-              [He kills another, then EXTON strikes him down]
--
--
shakes.txt-91563-    Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!  
shakes.txt-91564-    Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
shakes.txt-91565-    More direful hap betide that hated wretch
shakes.txt:91566:    That makes us wretched by the death of thee
shakes.txt-91567-    Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
shakes.txt-91568-    Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
shakes.txt-91569-    If ever he have child, abortive be it,
--
--
shakes.txt-91572-    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
shakes.txt-91573-    And that be heir to his unhappiness!
shakes.txt-91574-    If ever he have wife, let her be made
shakes.txt:91575:    More miserable by the death of him
shakes.txt-91576-    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
shakes.txt-91577-    Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
shakes.txt-91578-    Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
--
--
shakes.txt-91613-    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
shakes.txt-91614-    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
shakes.txt-91615-    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
shakes.txt:91616:    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
shakes.txt:91617:    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
shakes.txt-91618-    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
shakes.txt-91619-    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
shakes.txt-91620-    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
--
--
shakes.txt-91675-  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
shakes.txt-91676-    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
shakes.txt-91677-    And fall something into a slower method-
shakes.txt:91678:    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
shakes.txt-91679-    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
shakes.txt-91680-    As blameful as the executioner?
shakes.txt-91681-  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
--
--
shakes.txt-91681-  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
shakes.txt-91682-  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
shakes.txt-91683-    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep  
shakes.txt:91684:    To undertake the death of all the world
shakes.txt-91685-    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
shakes.txt-91686-  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
shakes.txt-91687-    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
--
--
shakes.txt-91690-    You should not blemish it if I stood by.
shakes.txt-91691-    As all the world is cheered by the sun,
shakes.txt-91692-    So I by that; it is my day, my life.
shakes.txt:91693:  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
shakes.txt-91694-  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
shakes.txt-91695-  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
shakes.txt-91696-  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,
--
--
shakes.txt-91715-  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
shakes.txt-91716-  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
shakes.txt-91717-  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;
shakes.txt:91718:    For now they kill me with a living death.
shakes.txt-91719-    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
shakes.txt-91720-    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
shakes.txt-91721-    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
--
--
shakes.txt-91723-    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made  
shakes.txt-91724-    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
shakes.txt-91725-    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
shakes.txt:91726:    Told the sad story of my father's death,
shakes.txt-91727-    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
shakes.txt-91728-    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
shakes.txt-91729-    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
--
--
shakes.txt-91742-    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
shakes.txt-91743-    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,  
shakes.txt-91744-    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
shakes.txt:91745:    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
shakes.txt-91746-      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
shakes.txt-91747-    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
shakes.txt-91748-    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
--
--
shakes.txt-91750-    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
shakes.txt-91751-                                           [She falls the sword]
shakes.txt-91752-    Take up the sword again, or take up me.
shakes.txt:91753:  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
shakes.txt-91754-    I will not be thy executioner.
shakes.txt-91755-  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
shakes.txt-91756-  ANNE. I have already.
--
--
shakes.txt-91758-    Speak it again, and even with the word
shakes.txt-91759-    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
shakes.txt-91760-    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
shakes.txt:91761:    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
shakes.txt-91762-  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
shakes.txt-91763-  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.  
shakes.txt-91764-  ANNE. I fear me both are false.
--
--
shakes.txt-92039-    sight?
shakes.txt-92040-  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
shakes.txt-92041-    That will I make before I let thee go.
shakes.txt:92042:  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
shakes.txt-92043-  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in  
shakes.txt-92044-    banishment
--
shakes.txt-92043-  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in  
shakes.txt-92044-    banishment
shakes.txt:92045:    Than death can yield me here by my abode.
shakes.txt-92046-    A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
shakes.txt-92047-    And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
shakes.txt-92048-    This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
--
--
shakes.txt-92065-    Ready to catch each other by the throat,
shakes.txt-92066-    And turn you all your hatred now on me?
shakes.txt-92067-    Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
shakes.txt:92068:    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
shakes.txt-92069-    Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
shakes.txt-92070-    Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
shakes.txt-92071-    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
--
--
shakes.txt-92077-    Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
shakes.txt-92078-    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
shakes.txt-92079-    Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
shakes.txt:92080:    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
shakes.txt-92081-    And see another, as I see thee now,
shakes.txt-92082-    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
--
shakes.txt-92081-    And see another, as I see thee now,
shakes.txt-92082-    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
shakes.txt:92083:    Long die thy happy days before thy death;  
shakes.txt-92084-    And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
shakes.txt-92085-    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
shakes.txt-92086-    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
--
--
shakes.txt-92150-    Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
shakes.txt-92151-    And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
shakes.txt-92152-  QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
shakes.txt:92153:    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
shakes.txt-92154-    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
shakes.txt-92155-    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
shakes.txt-92156-    Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
--
--
shakes.txt-92175-    And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
shakes.txt-92176-    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
shakes.txt-92177-    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
shakes.txt:92178:    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
shakes.txt-92179-    Have not to do with him, beware of him;
--
shakes.txt-92179-    Have not to do with him, beware of him;
shakes.txt:92180:    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
shakes.txt-92181-    And all their ministers attend on him.
shakes.txt-92182-  GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
shakes.txt-92183-  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.  
--
--
shakes.txt-92287-    Into the tumbling billows of the main.
shakes.txt-92288-    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
shakes.txt-92289-    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
shakes.txt:92290:    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
shakes.txt-92291-    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
shakes.txt-92292-    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
shakes.txt-92293-    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
--
--
shakes.txt-92298-    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
shakes.txt-92299-    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
shakes.txt-92300-    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
shakes.txt:92301:  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death
shakes.txt-92302-    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
shakes.txt-92303-  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive  
shakes.txt-92304-    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
--
--
shakes.txt-92460-    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
shakes.txt-92461-    What lawful quest have given their verdict up
shakes.txt-92462-    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
shakes.txt:92463:    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?  
shakes.txt-92464-    Before I be convict by course of law,
--
shakes.txt-92464-    Before I be convict by course of law,
shakes.txt:92465:    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
shakes.txt-92466-    I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
shakes.txt-92467-    By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
shakes.txt-92468-    That you depart and lay no hands on me.
--
--
shakes.txt-92510-    If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
shakes.txt-92511-    And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
shakes.txt-92512-    Who shall reward you better for my life
shakes.txt:92513:    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
shakes.txt-92514-  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
shakes.txt-92515-    hates you.
shakes.txt-92516-  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
--
--
shakes.txt-92669-    Have aught committed that is hardly borne
shakes.txt-92670-    To any in this presence, I desire
shakes.txt-92671-    To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
shakes.txt:92672:    'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
shakes.txt-92673-    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
shakes.txt-92674-    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
shakes.txt-92675-    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
--
--
shakes.txt-92717-  DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
shakes.txt-92718-    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
shakes.txt-92719-    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
shakes.txt:92720:  KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
shakes.txt-92721-    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
shakes.txt-92722-    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
--
shakes.txt-92721-    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
shakes.txt-92722-    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
shakes.txt:92723:    And yet his punishment was bitter death.
shakes.txt-92724-    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
shakes.txt-92725-    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
shakes.txt-92726-    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
--
--
shakes.txt-92730-    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
shakes.txt-92731-    And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
shakes.txt-92732-    Who told me, when we both lay in the field
shakes.txt:92733:    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
shakes.txt-92734-    Even in his garments, and did give himself,
shakes.txt-92735-    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
shakes.txt-92736-    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
--
--
shakes.txt-92752-                                 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
shakes.txt-92753-  GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
shakes.txt-92754-    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
shakes.txt:92755:    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
shakes.txt-92756-    O, they did urge it still unto the King!  
shakes.txt-92757-    God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
shakes.txt-92758-    To comfort Edward with our company?
--
--
shakes.txt-92776-    If that our noble father were alive?
shakes.txt-92777-  DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
shakes.txt-92778-    I do lament the sickness of the King,
shakes.txt:92779:    As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
shakes.txt-92780-    It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
shakes.txt-92781-  SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
shakes.txt-92782-    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
--
--
shakes.txt-92786-  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
shakes.txt-92787-    well.
shakes.txt-92788-    Incapable and shallow innocents,
shakes.txt:92789:    You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
shakes.txt-92790-  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
shakes.txt-92791-    Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
shakes.txt-92792-    Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
--
--
shakes.txt-92821-    To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
shakes.txt-92822-  DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
shakes.txt-92823-    As I had title in thy noble husband!
shakes.txt:92824:    I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
shakes.txt-92825-    And liv'd with looking on his images;  
shakes.txt-92826-    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
--
shakes.txt-92825-    And liv'd with looking on his images;  
shakes.txt-92826-    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
shakes.txt:92827:    Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
shakes.txt-92828-    And I for comfort have but one false glass,
shakes.txt-92829-    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
shakes.txt-92830-    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
--
--
shakes.txt-92829-    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
shakes.txt-92830-    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
shakes.txt-92831-    And hast the comfort of thy children left;
shakes.txt:92832:    But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
shakes.txt-92833-    And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
shakes.txt-92834-    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
shakes.txt-92835-    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
--
--
shakes.txt-92834-    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
shakes.txt-92835-    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
shakes.txt-92836-    To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
shakes.txt:92837:  SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
shakes.txt-92838-    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
shakes.txt-92839-  DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
shakes.txt-92840-    Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
--
--
shakes.txt-92960-  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!
shakes.txt-92961-  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.
shakes.txt-92962-  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
shakes.txt:92963:    death?
shakes.txt-92964-  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!  
shakes.txt-92965-  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous
shakes.txt-92966-    world.
--
--
shakes.txt-93091-    Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,
shakes.txt-93092-    Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
shakes.txt-93093-    And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
shakes.txt:93094:    Or let me die, to look on death no more!
shakes.txt-93095-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
shakes.txt-93096-    sanctuary.  
shakes.txt-93097-    Madam, farewell.
--
--
shakes.txt-93224-  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
shakes.txt-93225-    With what his valour did enrich his wit,
shakes.txt-93226-    His wit set down to make his valour live.
shakes.txt:93227:    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
shakes.txt-93228-    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
shakes.txt-93229-    I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-
shakes.txt-93230-  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?
--
--
shakes.txt-93242-  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.  
shakes.txt-93243-  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
shakes.txt-93244-    Too late he died that might have kept that title,
shakes.txt:93245:    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
shakes.txt-93246-  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
shakes.txt-93247-  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
shakes.txt-93248-    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
--
--
shakes.txt-93427-    Because they have been still my adversaries;
shakes.txt-93428-    But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
shakes.txt-93429-    To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
shakes.txt:93430:    God knows I will not do it to the death.
shakes.txt-93431-  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
shakes.txt-93432-  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
shakes.txt-93433-    That they which brought me in my master's hate,
--
--
shakes.txt-93484-    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
shakes.txt-93485-    By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
shakes.txt-93486-    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
shakes.txt:93487:    This day those enernies are put to death,
shakes.txt-93488-    And I in better state than e'er I was.
shakes.txt-93489-  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!
shakes.txt-93490-  HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
--

shakes.txt-93525-Pomfret Castle
shakes.txt-93526-
shakes.txt-93527-Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,
shakes.txt:93528:RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death
shakes.txt-93529-
shakes.txt-93530-  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
shakes.txt-93531-    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
--
--
shakes.txt-93537-  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
shakes.txt-93538-    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
shakes.txt-93539-    Within the guilty closure of thy walls
shakes.txt:93540:  RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;
shakes.txt-93541-    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
shakes.txt-93542-    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.
shakes.txt-93543-  GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
--
--
shakes.txt-93550-    And for my sister, and her princely sons,
shakes.txt-93551-    Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
shakes.txt-93552-    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
shakes.txt:93553:  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
shakes.txt-93554-  RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
shakes.txt-93555-    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt
shakes.txt-93556-
--
--
shakes.txt-93638-               Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
shakes.txt-93639-
shakes.txt-93640-  GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
shakes.txt:93641:    That do conspire my death with devilish plots  
shakes.txt-93642-    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
shakes.txt-93643-    Upon my body with their hellish charms?
shakes.txt-93644-  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
--
--
shakes.txt-93644-  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
shakes.txt-93645-    Makes me most forward in this princely presence
shakes.txt-93646-    To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
shakes.txt:93647:    I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
shakes.txt-93648-  GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
shakes.txt-93649-    Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm
shakes.txt-93650-    Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.
--
--
shakes.txt-93748-  MAYOR. Had he done so?
shakes.txt-93749-  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
shakes.txt-93750-    Or that we would, against the form of law,
shakes.txt:93751:    Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
shakes.txt-93752-    But that the extreme peril of the case,
shakes.txt-93753-    The peace of England and our persons' safety,
shakes.txt-93754-    Enforc'd us to this execution?
--
--
shakes.txt-93752-    But that the extreme peril of the case,
shakes.txt-93753-    The peace of England and our persons' safety,
shakes.txt-93754-    Enforc'd us to this execution?
shakes.txt:93755:  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
shakes.txt-93756-    And your good Graces both have well proceeded  
shakes.txt-93757-    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
shakes.txt-93758-    I never look'd for better at his hands
--
--
shakes.txt-93766-    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
shakes.txt-93767-    That you might well have signified the same
shakes.txt-93768-    Unto the citizens, who haply may
shakes.txt:93769:    Misconster us in him and wail his death.
shakes.txt-93770-  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
shakes.txt-93771-    As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
shakes.txt-93772-    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
--
--
shakes.txt-93782-    The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.
shakes.txt-93783-    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
shakes.txt-93784-    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
shakes.txt:93785:    Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
shakes.txt-93786-    Only for saying he would make his son
shakes.txt-93787-    Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,
shakes.txt-93788-    Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
--
--
shakes.txt-94197-  DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
shakes.txt-94198-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee
shakes.txt-94199-    gone!
shakes.txt:94200:    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
shakes.txt-94201-    Thy mother's name is ominous to children.  
--
shakes.txt-94201-    Thy mother's name is ominous to children.  
shakes.txt:94202:    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
shakes.txt-94203-    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
shakes.txt-94204-    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
shakes.txt-94205-    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
--
--
shakes.txt-94211-    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
shakes.txt-94212-    Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
shakes.txt-94213-  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
shakes.txt:94214:    O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
shakes.txt-94215-    A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
shakes.txt-94216-    Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
shakes.txt-94217-  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
--
--
shakes.txt-94234-    And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
shakes.txt-94235-    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
shakes.txt-94236-    More miserable by the life of thee
shakes.txt:94237:    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'
shakes.txt-94238-    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
shakes.txt-94239-    Within so small a time, my woman's heart
shakes.txt-94240-    Grossly grew captive to his honey words
--
--
shakes.txt-94317-  PAGE. My lord?
shakes.txt-94318-  KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom corrupting
shakes.txt-94319-    gold
shakes.txt:94320:    Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
shakes.txt-94321-  PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman
shakes.txt-94322-    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
shakes.txt-94323-    Gold were as good as twenty orators,
--
--
shakes.txt-94443-    To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
shakes.txt-94444-    Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
shakes.txt-94445-    Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
shakes.txt:94446:    Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
shakes.txt-94447-    'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
shakes.txt-94448-    'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
shakes.txt-94449-    Within their alabaster innocent arms.
--
--
shakes.txt-94472-  TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
shakes.txt-94473-    But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
shakes.txt-94474-  KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
shakes.txt:94475:    When thou shalt tell the process of their death.  
shakes.txt-94476-    Meantime, but think how I may do thee good
shakes.txt-94477-    And be inheritor of thy desire.
shakes.txt-94478-    Farewell till then.
--
--
shakes.txt-94514-Enter old QUEEN MARGARET
shakes.txt-94515-
shakes.txt-94516-  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow
shakes.txt:94517:    And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
shakes.txt-94518-    Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
shakes.txt-94519-    To watch the waning of mine enemies.
shakes.txt-94520-    A dire induction am I witness to,
--
--
shakes.txt-94571-  QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
shakes.txt-94572-    kill'd him.  
shakes.txt-94573-    From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
shakes.txt:94574:    A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
shakes.txt-94575-    That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
shakes.txt-94576-    To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
shakes.txt-94577-    That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
--
--
shakes.txt-94676-    crown
shakes.txt-94677-    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
shakes.txt-94678-    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
shakes.txt:94679:    And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
shakes.txt-94680-    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
shakes.txt-94681-  DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
shakes.txt-94682-    Clarence?
--
--
shakes.txt-94736-    Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
shakes.txt-94737-    And promise them success and victory.
shakes.txt-94738-    Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
shakes.txt:94739:    Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit
shakes.txt-94740-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less
shakes.txt-94741-      spirit to curse
shakes.txt-94742-    Abides in me; I say amen to her.
--
--
shakes.txt-94765-      contrary.
shakes.txt-94766-  KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
shakes.txt-94767-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
shakes.txt:94768:    My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
shakes.txt-94769-    If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
shakes.txt-94770-  KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
shakes.txt-94771-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
--
--
shakes.txt-94779-    But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,
shakes.txt-94780-    My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
shakes.txt-94781-    Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
shakes.txt:94782:    And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
shakes.txt-94783-    Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
shakes.txt-94784-    Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
shakes.txt-94785-  KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
--
--
shakes.txt-94951-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.
shakes.txt-94952-  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world-  
shakes.txt-94953-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
shakes.txt:94954:  KING RICHARD. My father's death-
shakes.txt-94955-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
shakes.txt-94956-  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-
shakes.txt-94957-  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.
--
--
shakes.txt-94988-    In her consists my happiness and thine;
shakes.txt-94989-    Without her, follows to myself and thee,
shakes.txt-94990-    Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
shakes.txt:94991:    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
shakes.txt-94992-    It cannot be avoided but by this;  
shakes.txt-94993-    It will not be avoided but by this.
shakes.txt-94994-    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-

shakes.txt-95115-
shakes.txt-95116-  THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
shakes.txt-95117-  KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of
shakes.txt:95118:    death?                                      [He strikes him]
shakes.txt-95119-    There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
shakes.txt-95120-  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
shakes.txt-95121-    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
--

shakes.txt-95459-                   Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE
shakes.txt-95460-
shakes.txt-95461-  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul
shakes.txt:95462:    to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
shakes.txt:95463:    Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!
shakes.txt-95464-    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
shakes.txt-95465-    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
shakes.txt-95466-    [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
--
--
shakes.txt-95494-  GHOSTS.  [To RICHARD]  Dream on thy cousins smothered in
shakes.txt-95495-    the Tower.
shakes.txt-95496-    Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
shakes.txt:95497:    And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
shakes.txt-95498-    Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
shakes.txt-95499-    [To RICHMOND]  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and
shakes.txt-95500-    wake in joy;
--
--
shakes.txt-95521-    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
shakes.txt-95522-    O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
shakes.txt-95523-    And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
shakes.txt:95524:    Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
shakes.txt-95525-    Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
shakes.txt-95526-    [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
shakes.txt-95527-    But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:  
--
--
shakes.txt-95750-    The King enacts more wonders than a man,
shakes.txt-95751-    Daring an opposite to every danger.
shakes.txt-95752-    His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
shakes.txt:95753:    Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
shakes.txt-95754-    Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.
shakes.txt-95755-
shakes.txt-95756-                     Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD
--
--
shakes.txt-95891-    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
shakes.txt-95892-    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
shakes.txt-95893-    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
shakes.txt:95894:    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
shakes.txt:95895:    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
shakes.txt-95896-    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
shakes.txt-95897-    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
shakes.txt-95898-    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
--
--
shakes.txt-95986-                          Enter Tybalt.
shakes.txt-95987-
shakes.txt-95988-  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
shakes.txt:95989:    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
shakes.txt-95990-  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
shakes.txt-95991-    Or manage it to part these men with me.
shakes.txt-95992-  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
--
--
shakes.txt-96035-    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
shakes.txt-96036-    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
shakes.txt-96037-    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
shakes.txt:96038:    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.  
shakes.txt-96039-              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
shakes.txt-96040-  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
shakes.txt-96041-    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
--
--
shakes.txt-96551-    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
shakes.txt-96552-    With this night's revels and expire the term
shakes.txt-96553-    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,  
shakes.txt:96554:    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
shakes.txt-96555-    But he that hath the steerage of my course
shakes.txt-96556-    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
shakes.txt-96557-  Ben. Strike, drum.
--
--
shakes.txt-96744-
shakes.txt-96745-Enter Chorus.
shakes.txt-96746-
shakes.txt:96747:  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
shakes.txt-96748-    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
shakes.txt-96749-    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
shakes.txt-96750-    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
--
--
shakes.txt-96897-  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
shakes.txt-96898-  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
shakes.txt-96899-    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
shakes.txt:96900:    And the place death, considering who thou art,
shakes.txt-96901-    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
shakes.txt-96902-  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
shakes.txt-96903-    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
--
--
shakes.txt-96911-  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
shakes.txt-96912-    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
shakes.txt-96913-    My life were better ended by their hate
shakes.txt:96914:    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
shakes.txt-96915-  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
shakes.txt-96916-  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
shakes.txt-96917-    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
--
--
shakes.txt-97080-    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
shakes.txt-97081-    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
shakes.txt-97082-    And where the worser is predominant,
shakes.txt:97083:    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
shakes.txt-97084-
shakes.txt-97085-                        Enter Romeo.
shakes.txt-97086-
--
--
shakes.txt-97423-    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
shakes.txt-97424-    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
shakes.txt-97425-    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
shakes.txt:97426:    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
shakes.txt-97427-  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
shakes.txt-97428-    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?  
shakes.txt-97429-  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
--
--
shakes.txt-97467-    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
shakes.txt-97468-    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
shakes.txt-97469-    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
shakes.txt:97470:    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
shakes.txt-97471-    It is enough I may but call her mine.
shakes.txt-97472-  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
shakes.txt-97473-    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
--
--
shakes.txt-97625-    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
shakes.txt-97626-    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
shakes.txt-97627-    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
shakes.txt:97628:    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a
shakes.txt-97629-    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
shakes.txt-97630-    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
shakes.txt-97631-  Rom. I thought all for the best.
--
--
shakes.txt-97667-                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
shakes.txt-97668-  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
shakes.txt-97669-    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
shakes.txt:97670:    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
shakes.txt-97671-    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
shakes.txt-97672-  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
shakes.txt-97673-  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
--
--
shakes.txt-97704-    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
shakes.txt-97705-    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
shakes.txt-97706-    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
shakes.txt:97707:    Cold death aside and with the other sends
shakes.txt-97708-    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
shakes.txt-97709-    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
shakes.txt-97710-    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
--
--
shakes.txt-97803-    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
shakes.txt-97804-    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
shakes.txt-97805-    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
shakes.txt:97806:    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
shakes.txt-97807-    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
shakes.txt-97808-    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
shakes.txt-97809-    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
--
--
shakes.txt-97866-    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
shakes.txt-97867-    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
shakes.txt-97868-    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
shakes.txt:97869:    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
shakes.txt-97870-    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;  
shakes.txt-97871-    But O, it presses to my memory
shakes.txt-97872-    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
--
--
shakes.txt-97872-    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
shakes.txt-97873-    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
shakes.txt-97874-    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
shakes.txt:97875:    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
shakes.txt-97876-    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
shakes.txt-97877-    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
shakes.txt-97878-    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
--
--
shakes.txt-97879-    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
shakes.txt-97880-    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
shakes.txt-97881-    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
shakes.txt:97882:    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
shakes.txt-97883-    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
shakes.txt-97884-    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
shakes.txt-97885-    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
--
--
shakes.txt-97884-    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
shakes.txt-97885-    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
shakes.txt-97886-    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
shakes.txt:97887:    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
shakes.txt-97888-    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
shakes.txt-97889-  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
shakes.txt-97890-    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.  
--
--
shakes.txt-97895-    He made you for a highway to my bed;
shakes.txt-97896-    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
shakes.txt-97897-    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
shakes.txt:97898:    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
shakes.txt-97899-  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
shakes.txt-97900-    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
shakes.txt-97901-    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
--
--
shakes.txt-97926-    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
shakes.txt-97927-  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
shakes.txt-97928-  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
shakes.txt:97929:    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
shakes.txt:97930:  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
shakes.txt-97931-    For exile hath more terror in his look,  
--
shakes.txt-97931-    For exile hath more terror in his look,  
shakes.txt:97932:    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
shakes.txt-97933-  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
shakes.txt-97934-    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
shakes.txt-97935-  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
--
--
shakes.txt-97935-  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
shakes.txt-97936-    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
shakes.txt-97937-    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
shakes.txt:97938:    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
shakes.txt:97939:    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
shakes.txt-97940-    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
shakes.txt-97941-    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
shakes.txt-97942-  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
--
--
shakes.txt-97940-    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
shakes.txt-97941-    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
shakes.txt-97942-  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
shakes.txt:97943:    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
shakes.txt-97944-    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
--
shakes.txt-97944-    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
shakes.txt:97945:    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
shakes.txt-97946-    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
shakes.txt-97947-  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
shakes.txt-97948-    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
--
--
shakes.txt-97958-    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
shakes.txt-97959-    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
shakes.txt-97960-    They are free men, but I am banished.
shakes.txt:97961:    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
shakes.txt-97962-    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
--
shakes.txt-97962-    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
shakes.txt:97963:    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
shakes.txt-97964-    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
shakes.txt-97965-    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
shakes.txt-97966-    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
--
--
shakes.txt-98014-    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
shakes.txt-98015-    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
shakes.txt-98016-  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
shakes.txt:98017:  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
shakes.txt-98018-  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
shakes.txt-98019-    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
shakes.txt-98020-    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
--
--
shakes.txt-98063-    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
shakes.txt-98064-    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
shakes.txt-98065-    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
shakes.txt:98066:    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
shakes.txt-98067-    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
shakes.txt-98068-    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
shakes.txt-98069-    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
--
--
shakes.txt-98173-    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
shakes.txt-98174-    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
shakes.txt-98175-    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
shakes.txt:98176:  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.  
shakes.txt-98177-    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
shakes.txt-98178-    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
shakes.txt-98179-    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
--
--
shakes.txt-98180-    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
shakes.txt-98181-    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
shakes.txt-98182-    I have more care to stay than will to go.
shakes.txt:98183:    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
shakes.txt-98184-    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
shakes.txt-98185-  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
shakes.txt-98186-    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
--
--
shakes.txt-98236-  
shakes.txt-98237-  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
shakes.txt-98238-  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
shakes.txt:98239:  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
shakes.txt-98240-    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
shakes.txt-98241-    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
shakes.txt-98242-    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
--
--
shakes.txt-98246-    Which you weep for.
shakes.txt-98247-  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
shakes.txt-98248-    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
shakes.txt:98249:  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
shakes.txt-98250-    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
shakes.txt-98251-  Jul. What villain, madam?
shakes.txt-98252-  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
--
--
shakes.txt-98255-    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
shakes.txt-98256-  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.  
shakes.txt-98257-  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
shakes.txt:98258:    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
shakes.txt-98259-  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
shakes.txt-98260-    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
shakes.txt-98261-    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
--
--
shakes.txt-98447-    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
shakes.txt-98448-  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
shakes.txt-98449-    Uneven is the course; I like it not.
shakes.txt:98450:  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
shakes.txt-98451-    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
shakes.txt-98452-    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
shakes.txt-98453-    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
--
--
shakes.txt-98519-    If, rather than to marry County Paris
shakes.txt-98520-    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
shakes.txt-98521-    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake  
shakes.txt:98522:    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
shakes.txt:98523:    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
shakes.txt-98524-    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
shakes.txt-98525-  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
shakes.txt-98526-    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
--
--
shakes.txt-98546-    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
shakes.txt-98547-    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
shakes.txt-98548-    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
shakes.txt:98549:    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
shakes.txt-98550-    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
--
shakes.txt-98550-    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
shakes.txt:98551:    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
shakes.txt:98552:    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
shakes.txt-98553-    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
shakes.txt-98554-    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
shakes.txt-98555-    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
--
--
shakes.txt-98690-    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
shakes.txt-98691-    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
shakes.txt-98692-    Or, if I live, is it not very like
shakes.txt:98693:    The horrible conceit of death and night,
shakes.txt-98694-    Together with the terror of the place-
shakes.txt-98695-    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
shakes.txt-98696-    Where for this many hundred years the bones
--
--
shakes.txt-98809-  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
shakes.txt-98810-    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
shakes.txt-98811-    Life and these lips have long been separated.
shakes.txt:98812:    Death lies on her like an untimely frost  
shakes.txt-98813-    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
shakes.txt-98814-  Nurse. O lamentable day!
shakes.txt-98815-  Mother. O woful time!
--
--
shakes.txt-98813-    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
shakes.txt-98814-  Nurse. O lamentable day!
shakes.txt-98815-  Mother. O woful time!
shakes.txt:98816:  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
shakes.txt-98817-    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
shakes.txt-98818-
shakes.txt-98819-  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
--
--
shakes.txt-98821-  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
shakes.txt-98822-  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
shakes.txt-98823-    O son, the night before thy wedding day
shakes.txt:98824:    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
shakes.txt-98825-    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
--
shakes.txt-98825-    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
shakes.txt:98826:    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
shakes.txt-98827-    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
--
shakes.txt-98827-    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
shakes.txt:98828:    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
shakes.txt-98829-  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
shakes.txt-98830-    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
shakes.txt-98831-  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
--
--
shakes.txt-98833-    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
shakes.txt-98834-    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
shakes.txt-98835-    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
shakes.txt:98836:    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
shakes.txt-98837-  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
shakes.txt-98838-    Most lamentable day, most woful day
shakes.txt-98839-    That ever ever I did yet behold!
--
--
shakes.txt-98841-    Never was seen so black a day as this.
shakes.txt-98842-    O woful day! O woful day!
shakes.txt-98843-  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
shakes.txt:98844:    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
shakes.txt-98845-    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
--
shakes.txt-98845-    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
shakes.txt:98846:    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
shakes.txt-98847-  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
shakes.txt-98848-    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
shakes.txt-98849-    To murther, murther our solemnity?
--
--
shakes.txt-98854-    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
shakes.txt-98855-    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
shakes.txt-98856-    And all the better is it for the maid.
shakes.txt:98857:    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
shakes.txt-98858-    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
shakes.txt-98859-    The most you sought was her promotion,
shakes.txt-98860-    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
--
--
shakes.txt-99008-    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
shakes.txt-99009-    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
shakes.txt-99010-    'An if a man did need a poison now
shakes.txt:99011:    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,  
shakes.txt-99012-    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
shakes.txt-99013-    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
shakes.txt-99014-    And this same needy man must sell it me.
--
--
shakes.txt-99027-    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
shakes.txt-99028-    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
shakes.txt-99029-  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
shakes.txt:99030:    Is death to any he that utters them.
shakes.txt-99031-  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness  
shakes.txt-99032-    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
shakes.txt-99033-    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
--
--
shakes.txt-99131-    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
shakes.txt-99132-    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
shakes.txt-99133-    And do not interrupt me in my course.
shakes.txt:99134:    Why I descend into this bed of death
shakes.txt-99135-    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
shakes.txt-99136-    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
shakes.txt-99137-    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
--
--
shakes.txt-99148-    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
shakes.txt-99149-  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
shakes.txt-99150-    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
shakes.txt:99151:  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
shakes.txt-99152-    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
shakes.txt-99153-    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
shakes.txt-99154-    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
--
--
shakes.txt-99159-    And here is come to do some villanous shame
shakes.txt-99160-    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
shakes.txt-99161-    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
shakes.txt:99162:    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
shakes.txt-99163-    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
shakes.txt-99164-    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
shakes.txt-99165-  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
--
--
shakes.txt-99193-    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
shakes.txt-99194-    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
shakes.txt-99195-    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
shakes.txt:99196:    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
shakes.txt-99197-                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
--
shakes.txt-99197-                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
shakes.txt:99198:    How oft when men are at the point of death  
shakes.txt-99199-    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
--
shakes.txt-99199-    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
shakes.txt:99200:    A lightning before death. O, how may I
shakes.txt-99201-    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
--
shakes.txt-99201-    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
shakes.txt:99202:    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
shakes.txt-99203-    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
shakes.txt-99204-    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
shakes.txt-99205-    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
--
--
shakes.txt-99203-    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
shakes.txt-99204-    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
shakes.txt-99205-    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
shakes.txt:99206:    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
shakes.txt-99207-    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
shakes.txt-99208-    O, what more favour can I do to thee
shakes.txt-99209-    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
--
--
shakes.txt-99210-    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
shakes.txt-99211-    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
shakes.txt-99212-    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
shakes.txt:99213:    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
shakes.txt-99214-    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
shakes.txt-99215-    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
shakes.txt-99216-    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
--
--
shakes.txt-99222-    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
shakes.txt-99223-    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
shakes.txt-99224-    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
shakes.txt:99225:    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
shakes.txt-99226-    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
shakes.txt-99227-    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
shakes.txt-99228-    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
--
--
shakes.txt-99247-  Friar. Go with me to the vault.
shakes.txt-99248-  Bal. I dare not, sir.
shakes.txt-99249-    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
shakes.txt:99250:    And fearfully did menace me with death
shakes.txt-99251-    If I did stay to look on his intents.
shakes.txt-99252-  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
shakes.txt-99253-    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
--
--
shakes.txt-99267-    I do remember well where I should be,
shakes.txt-99268-    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
shakes.txt-99269-  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
shakes.txt:99270:    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
shakes.txt-99271-    A greater power than we can contradict
shakes.txt-99272-    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
shakes.txt-99273-    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
--
--
shakes.txt-99341-    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
shakes.txt-99342-    Is empty on the back of Montague,
shakes.txt-99343-    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
shakes.txt:99344:  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
shakes.txt-99345-    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
shakes.txt-99346-
shakes.txt-99347-               Enter Montague [and others].
--
--
shakes.txt-99358-    Till we can clear these ambiguities  
shakes.txt-99359-    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
shakes.txt-99360-    And then will I be general of your woes
shakes.txt:99361:    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
shakes.txt-99362-    And let mischance be slave to patience.
shakes.txt-99363-    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
shakes.txt-99364-  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
--
--
shakes.txt-99372-    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
shakes.txt-99373-    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
shakes.txt-99374-    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
shakes.txt:99375:    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
shakes.txt-99376-    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
shakes.txt-99377-    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
shakes.txt-99378-    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,  
--
--
shakes.txt-99384-    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
shakes.txt-99385-    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
shakes.txt-99386-    As I intended, for it wrought on her
shakes.txt:99387:    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
shakes.txt-99388-    That he should hither come as this dire night
shakes.txt-99389-    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
shakes.txt-99390-    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
--
--
shakes.txt-99410-    Unto the rigour of severest law.
shakes.txt-99411-  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
shakes.txt-99412-    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
shakes.txt:99413:  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
shakes.txt-99414-    And then in post he came from Mantua
shakes.txt-99415-    To this same place, to this same monument.
shakes.txt-99416-    This letter he early bid me give his father,
--
--
shakes.txt-99414-    And then in post he came from Mantua
shakes.txt-99415-    To this same place, to this same monument.
shakes.txt-99416-    This letter he early bid me give his father,
shakes.txt:99417:    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
shakes.txt-99418-    If I departed not and left him there.  
shakes.txt-99419-  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
shakes.txt-99420-    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
--
--
shakes.txt-99425-    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
shakes.txt-99426-    And then I ran away to call the watch.
shakes.txt-99427-  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
shakes.txt:99428:    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
shakes.txt-99429-    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
shakes.txt-99430-    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
shakes.txt-99431-    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
--
--
shakes.txt-99561-  SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
shakes.txt-99562-    This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
shakes.txt-99563-  LORD. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
shakes.txt:99564:    Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!  
shakes.txt-99565-    Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
shakes.txt-99566-    What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
shakes.txt-99567-    Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
--
--
shakes.txt-100575-    Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
shakes.txt-100576-    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,  
shakes.txt-100577-    What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
shakes.txt:100578:  BAPTISTA. After my death, the one half of my lands
shakes.txt-100579-    And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
shakes.txt-100580-  PETRUCHIO. And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
shakes.txt-100581-    Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
--
--
shakes.txt-101329-  CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
shakes.txt-101330-  GRUMIO. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
shakes.txt-101331-    therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and
shakes.txt:101332:    mistress are almost frozen to death.
shakes.txt-101333-  CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
shakes.txt-101334-  GRUMIO. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
shakes.txt-101335-  CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
--
--
shakes.txt-101625-  TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
shakes.txt-101626-    And come to Padua, careless of your life!
shakes.txt-101627-  PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.  
shakes.txt:101628:  TRANIO. 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
shakes.txt-101629-    To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
shakes.txt-101630-    Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
shakes.txt-101631-    For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
--
--
shakes.txt-101688-    And that which spites me more than all these wants-
shakes.txt-101689-    He does it under name of perfect love;
shakes.txt-101690-    As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
shakes.txt:101691:    'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
shakes.txt-101692-    I prithee go and get me some repast;
shakes.txt-101693-    I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
shakes.txt-101694-  GRUMIO. What say you to a neat's foot?  
--
--
shakes.txt-101821-  GRUMIO. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
shakes.txt-101822-  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
shakes.txt-101823-  GRUMIO. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
shakes.txt:101824:    skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread; I
shakes.txt-101825-    said a gown.
shakes.txt-101826-  PETRUCHIO. Proceed.
shakes.txt-101827-  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
--
--
shakes.txt-102664-  GONZALO. Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
shakes.txt-102665-    an acre of barren ground-long heath, brown furze, any
shakes.txt-102666-    thing. The wills above be done, but I would fain die
shakes.txt:102667:    dry death.                                            Exeunt
shakes.txt-102668-
shakes.txt-102669-

shakes.txt-103611-  ANTONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit
shakes.txt-103612-    Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel
shakes.txt-103613-    Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
shakes.txt:103614:    And let Sebastian wake.' Say this were death
shakes.txt-103615-    That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse
shakes.txt-103616-    Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples  
shakes.txt-103617-    As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate

shakes.txt-103871-  CALIBAN. I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy
shakes.txt-103872-    subject.
shakes.txt-103873-  STEPHANO. Come on, then; down, and swear.
shakes.txt:103874:  TRINCULO. I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-
shakes.txt-103875-    headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in
shakes.txt-103876-    my heart to beat him-
shakes.txt-103877-  STEPHANO. Come, kiss.
--
--
shakes.txt-104089-    lord?
shakes.txt-104090-  TRINCULO. 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such
shakes.txt-104091-    a natural!
shakes.txt:104092:  CALIBAN. Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
shakes.txt-104093-  STEPHANO. Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head; if
shakes.txt-104094-    you prove a mutineer-the next tree! The poor monster's
shakes.txt-104095-    my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.  
--
--
shakes.txt-104330-    Incens'd the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
shakes.txt-104331-    Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
shakes.txt-104332-    They have bereft; and do pronounce by me
shakes.txt:104333:    Ling'ring perdition, worse than any death
shakes.txt-104334-    Can be at once, shall step by step attend
shakes.txt-104335-    You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from-
shakes.txt-104336-    Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls

shakes.txt-105078-    To take my life. Two of these fellows you
shakes.txt-105079-    Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
shakes.txt-105080-    Acknowledge mine.
shakes.txt:105081:  CALIBAN. I shall be pinch'd to death.
shakes.txt-105082-  ALONSO. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
shakes.txt-105083-  SEBASTIAN. He is drunk now; where had he wine?
shakes.txt-105084-  ALONSO. And Trinculo is reeling ripe; where should they

shakes.txt-105487-  TIMON. Whither art going?
shakes.txt-105488-  APEMANTUS. To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
shakes.txt-105489-  TIMON. That's a deed thou't die for.  
shakes.txt:105490:  APEMANTUS. Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.
shakes.txt-105491-  TIMON. How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?
shakes.txt-105492-  APEMANTUS. The best, for the innocence.
shakes.txt-105493-  TIMON. Wrought he not well that painted it?
--
--
shakes.txt-106055-  APEMANTUS. There will little learning die, then, that day thou art
shakes.txt-106056-    hang'd. This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades. Go; thou wast
shakes.txt-106057-    born a bastard, and thou't die a bawd.
shakes.txt:106058:  PAGE. Thou wast whelp'd a dog, and thou shalt famish dog's death.
shakes.txt-106059-    Answer not: I am gone.                             Exit PAGE
shakes.txt-106060-  APEMANTUS. E'en so thou outrun'st grace.
shakes.txt-106061-    Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon's.

shakes.txt-106205-    Go to Ventidius. Prithee be not sad,
shakes.txt-106206-    Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
shakes.txt-106207-    No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately
shakes.txt:106208:    Buried his father, by whose death he's stepp'd
shakes.txt-106209-    Into a great estate. When he was poor,  
shakes.txt-106210-    Imprison'd, and in scarcity of friends,
shakes.txt-106211-    I clear'd him with five talents. Greet him from me,

shakes.txt-106294-    Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
shakes.txt-106295-    When he is turn'd to poison?  
shakes.txt-106296-    O, may diseases only work upon't!
shakes.txt:106297:    And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
shakes.txt-106298-    Which my lord paid for be of any power
shakes.txt-106299-    To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!                Exit

shakes.txt-106626-    Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice-  
shakes.txt-106627-    An honour in him which buys out his fault-
shakes.txt-106628-    But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
shakes.txt:106629:    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
shakes.txt-106630-    He did oppose his foe;
shakes.txt-106631-    And with such sober and unnoted passion
shakes.txt-106632-    He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent,

shakes.txt-107408-    Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
shakes.txt-107409-    Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
shakes.txt-107410-    Thy gravestone daily; make thine epitaph,
shakes.txt:107411:    That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
shakes.txt-107412-    [Looks at the gold] O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
shakes.txt-107413-    'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
shakes.txt-107414-    Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!

shakes.txt-107850-    And let my gravestone be your oracle.
shakes.txt-107851-    Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
shakes.txt-107852-    What is amiss, plague and infection mend!
shakes.txt:107853:    Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
shakes.txt-107854-    Sun, hide thy beams. Timon hath done his reign.
shakes.txt-107855-                                        Exit TIMON into his cave
shakes.txt-107856-  FIRST SENATOR. His discontents are unremovably

shakes.txt-107955-    Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess
shakes.txt-107956-    Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
shakes.txt-107957-    Into our city with thy banners spread.  
shakes.txt:107958:    By decimation and a tithed death-
shakes.txt-107959-    If thy revenges hunger for that food
shakes.txt-107960-    Which nature loathes- take thou the destin'd tenth,
shakes.txt-107961-    And by the hazard of the spotted die
--
--
shakes.txt-108669-    I do remit these young men's heinous faults.
shakes.txt-108670-    Stand up.
shakes.txt-108671-    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
shakes.txt:108672:    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore  
shakes.txt-108673-    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
shakes.txt-108674-    Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,
shakes.txt-108675-    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
--
--
shakes.txt-108782-  AARON. Why, are ye mad, or know ye not in Rome
shakes.txt-108783-    How furious and impatient they be,
shakes.txt-108784-    And cannot brook competitors in love?
shakes.txt:108785:    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
shakes.txt-108786-    By this device.
--
shakes.txt-108786-    By this device.
shakes.txt:108787:  CHIRON. Aaron, a thousand deaths
shakes.txt-108788-    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
shakes.txt-108789-  AARON. To achieve her- how?
shakes.txt-108790-  DEMETRIUS. Why mak'st thou it so strange?
--
--
shakes.txt-108937-    Even as an adder when she doth unroll
shakes.txt-108938-    To do some fatal execution?
shakes.txt-108939-    No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
shakes.txt:108940:    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
shakes.txt-108941-    Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
shakes.txt-108942-    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
shakes.txt-108943-    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
--
--
shakes.txt-109013-    No sooner had they told this hellish tale
shakes.txt-109014-    But straight they told me they would bind me here
shakes.txt-109015-    Unto the body of a dismal yew,  
shakes.txt:109016:    And leave me to this miserable death.
shakes.txt-109017-    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
shakes.txt-109018-    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
shakes.txt-109019-    That ever ear did hear to such effect;
--
--
shakes.txt-109080-    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
shakes.txt-109081-    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
shakes.txt-109082-  TAMORA. What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
shakes.txt:109083:  LAVINIA. 'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,
shakes.txt-109084-    That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
shakes.txt-109085-    O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
shakes.txt-109086-    And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
--
--
shakes.txt-109133-    My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
shakes.txt-109134-  MARTIUS. To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
shakes.txt-109135-    Aaron and thou look down into this den,  
shakes.txt:109136:    And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
shakes.txt-109137-  QUINTUS. Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
shakes.txt-109138-    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
shakes.txt-109139-    The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
--
--
shakes.txt-109228-  SATURNINUS. Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.
shakes.txt-109229-    Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers;
shakes.txt-109230-    Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain;
shakes.txt:109231:    For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
shakes.txt-109232-    That end upon them should be executed.
shakes.txt-109233-  TAMORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
shakes.txt-109234-    Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
--
--
shakes.txt-109354-             Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn
shakes.txt-109355-
shakes.txt-109356-    O reverend Tribunes! O gentle aged men!
shakes.txt:109357:    Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
shakes.txt-109358-    And let me say, that never wept before,
shakes.txt-109359-    My tears are now prevailing orators.
shakes.txt-109360-  LUCIUS. O noble father, you lament in vain;
--
--
shakes.txt-109377-    Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
shakes.txt-109378-    A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
shakes.txt-109379-    A stone is silent and offendeth not,
shakes.txt:109380:    And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
shakes.txt-109381-                                                         [Rises]
shakes.txt-109382-    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?  
--
shakes.txt-109381-                                                         [Rises]
shakes.txt-109382-    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?  
shakes.txt:109383:  LUCIUS. To rescue my two brothers from their death;
shakes.txt-109384-    For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
shakes.txt-109385-    My everlasting doom of banishment.
shakes.txt-109386-  TITUS. O happy man! they have befriended thee.
--
--
shakes.txt-109433-    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
shakes.txt-109434-    Expecting ever when some envious surge
shakes.txt-109435-    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
shakes.txt:109436:    This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
shakes.txt-109437-    Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
shakes.txt-109438-    And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
shakes.txt-109439-    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
--
--
shakes.txt-109443-    Now I behold thy lively body so?
shakes.txt-109444-    Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
shakes.txt-109445-    Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee;
shakes.txt:109446:    Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
shakes.txt-109447-    Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
shakes.txt-109448-    Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
shakes.txt-109449-    When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
--
--
shakes.txt-109510-    Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
shakes.txt-109511-    O, none of both but are of high desert!
shakes.txt-109512-    My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
shakes.txt:109513:    To ransom my two nephews from their death;
shakes.txt-109514-    Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
shakes.txt-109515-  AARON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
shakes.txt-109516-    For fear they die before their pardon come.
--
--
shakes.txt-109519-  TITUS. Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
shakes.txt-109520-    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
shakes.txt-109521-  LUCIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
shakes.txt:109522:    Let me redeem my brothers both from death.  
shakes.txt-109523-  MARCUS. And for our father's sake and mother's care,
shakes.txt-109524-    Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
shakes.txt-109525-  TITUS. Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
--
--
shakes.txt-109587-    And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back-
shakes.txt-109588-    Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mock'd,
shakes.txt-109589-    That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
shakes.txt:109590:    More than remembrance of my father's death.             Exit
shakes.txt-109591-  MARCUS. Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
shakes.txt-109592-    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
shakes.txt-109593-    These miseries are more than may be borne.
--
--
shakes.txt-109592-    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
shakes.txt-109593-    These miseries are more than may be borne.
shakes.txt-109594-    To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
shakes.txt:109595:    But sorrow flouted at is double death.
shakes.txt-109596-  LUCIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
shakes.txt-109597-    And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
--
shakes.txt-109596-  LUCIUS. Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
shakes.txt-109597-    And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
shakes.txt:109598:    That ever death should let life bear his name,
shakes.txt-109599-    Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
shakes.txt-109600-                                          [LAVINIA kisses TITUS]
shakes.txt-109601-  MARCUS. Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
--
--
shakes.txt-109717-  MARCUS. At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
shakes.txt-109718-  TITUS. Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
shakes.txt-109719-    Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny;  
shakes.txt:109720:    A deed of death done on the innocent
shakes.txt-109721-    Becomes not Titus' brother. Get thee gone;
shakes.txt-109722-    I see thou art not for my company.
shakes.txt-109723-  MARCUS. Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
--
--
shakes.txt-110038-    Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
shakes.txt-110039-  DEMETRIUS. By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
shakes.txt-110040-  CHIRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
shakes.txt:110041:  NURSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
shakes.txt-110042-  CHIRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.
shakes.txt-110043-  AARON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
shakes.txt-110044-    Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
--
--
shakes.txt-110465-    Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
shakes.txt-110466-    Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,
shakes.txt-110467-    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd;
shakes.txt:110468:    And this shall all be buried in my death,
shakes.txt-110469-    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
shakes.txt-110470-  LUCIUS. Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
shakes.txt-110471-  AARON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
--
--
shakes.txt-110526-    Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think,
shakes.txt-110527-    Few come within the compass of my curse-
shakes.txt-110528-    Wherein I did not some notorious ill;
shakes.txt:110529:    As kill a man, or else devise his death;
shakes.txt-110530-    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
shakes.txt-110531-    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
shakes.txt-110532-    Set deadly enmity between two friends;  
--
--
shakes.txt-110544-    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
shakes.txt-110545-    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
shakes.txt-110546-  LUCIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die
shakes.txt:110547:    So sweet a death as hanging presently.
shakes.txt-110548-  AARON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,
shakes.txt-110549-    To live and burn in everlasting fire,
shakes.txt-110550-    So I might have your company in hell
--
--
shakes.txt-110612-    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
shakes.txt-110613-    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
shakes.txt-110614-    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;  
shakes.txt:110615:    Confer with me of murder and of death;
shakes.txt-110616-    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
shakes.txt-110617-    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
shakes.txt-110618-    Where bloody murder or detested rape
--
--
shakes.txt-110689-    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
shakes.txt-110690-    Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
shakes.txt-110691-    For up and down she doth resemble thee.
shakes.txt:110692:    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
shakes.txt-110693-    They have been violent to me and mine.
shakes.txt-110694-  TAMORA. Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.  
shakes.txt-110695-    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
--
--
shakes.txt-110767-    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud;
shakes.txt-110768-    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
shakes.txt-110769-    You kill'd her husband; and for that vile fault
shakes.txt:110770:    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
shakes.txt-110771-    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
shakes.txt-110772-    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
shakes.txt-110773-    Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
--
--
shakes.txt-110891-  SATURNINUS. Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
shakes.txt-110892-                                                [He stabs TITUS]
shakes.txt-110893-  LUCIUS. Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
shakes.txt:110894:    There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed.
shakes.txt-110895-                   [He stabs SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS,
shakes.txt-110896-               MARCUS, and their friends go up into the balcony]
shakes.txt-110897-  MARCUS. You sad-fac'd men, people and sons of Rome,
--
--
shakes.txt-110972-  ALL. Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal Emperor!
shakes.txt-110973-  MARCUS. Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
shakes.txt-110974-    And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
shakes.txt:110975:    To be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death,
shakes.txt-110976-    As punishment for his most wicked life.          Exeunt some
shakes.txt-110977-              attendants. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend
shakes.txt-110978-  ALL. Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
--
--
shakes.txt-112312-    There's not the meanest spirit on our party
shakes.txt-112313-    Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
shakes.txt-112314-    When Helen is defended; nor none so noble
shakes.txt:112315:    Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd
shakes.txt-112316-    Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say,
shakes.txt-112317-    Well may we fight for her whom we know well
shakes.txt-112318-    The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
--
--
shakes.txt-112405-    matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly
shakes.txt-112406-    and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from
shakes.txt-112407-    a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
shakes.txt:112408:    direction till thy death. Then if she that lays thee out says
shakes.txt-112409-    thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never
shakes.txt-112410-    shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where's Achilles?
shakes.txt-112411-  PATROCLUS. What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?
--
--
shakes.txt-112446-    Thersites.                                                   Exit
shakes.txt-112447-  THERSITES. Here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery.
shakes.txt-112448-    All the argument is a whore and a cuckold-a good quarrel to draw
shakes.txt:112449:    emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on
shakes.txt-112450-    the subject, and war and lechery confound all!               Exit
shakes.txt-112451-
shakes.txt-112452-         Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES,
--
--
shakes.txt-112556-    That 'twixt his mental and his active parts  
shakes.txt-112557-    Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages,
shakes.txt-112558-    And batters down himself. What should I say?
shakes.txt:112559:    He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
shakes.txt-112560-    Cry 'No recovery.'
shakes.txt-112561-  AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him.
shakes.txt-112562-    Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent.
--
--
shakes.txt-112849-    Th' imaginary relish is so sweet
shakes.txt-112850-    That it enchants my sense; what will it be
shakes.txt-112851-    When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed
shakes.txt:112852:    Love's thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me;
shakes.txt-112853-    Swooning destruction; or some joy too fine,
shakes.txt-112854-    Too subtle-potent, tun'd too sharp in sweetness,
shakes.txt-112855-    For the capacity of my ruder powers.
--
--
shakes.txt-113034-  CRESSIDA. Amen.
shakes.txt-113035-  PANDARUS. Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber
shakes.txt-113036-    and a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
shakes.txt:113037:    pretty encounters, press it to death. Away!
shakes.txt-113038-    And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,
shakes.txt-113039-    Bed, chamber, pander, to provide this gear!                Exeunt
shakes.txt-113040-
--
--
shakes.txt-113470-    Of her contaminated carrion weight
shakes.txt-113471-    A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
shakes.txt-113472-    She hath not given so many good words breath
shakes.txt:113473:    As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death.
shakes.txt-113474-  PARIS. Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
shakes.txt-113475-    Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy;
shakes.txt-113476-    But we in silence hold this virtue well:
--
--
shakes.txt-113587-  PANDARUS. Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
shakes.txt-113588-  CRESSIDA. O the gods! What's the matter?
shakes.txt-113589-  PANDARUS. Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst ne'er been born!
shakes.txt:113590:    I knew thou wouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague
shakes.txt-113591-    upon Antenor!
shakes.txt-113592-  CRESSIDA. Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you,
shakes.txt-113593-    what's the matter?
--
--
shakes.txt-113593-    what's the matter?
shakes.txt-113594-  PANDARUS. Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art
shakes.txt-113595-    chang'd for Antenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from
shakes.txt:113596:    Troilus. 'Twill be his death; 'twill be his bane; he cannot bear
shakes.txt-113597-    it.
shakes.txt-113598-  CRESSIDA. O you immortal gods! I will not go.
shakes.txt-113599-  PANDARUS. Thou must.
--
--
shakes.txt-113602-    No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me
shakes.txt-113603-    As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,  
shakes.txt-113604-    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
shakes.txt:113605:    If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
shakes.txt-113606-    Do to this body what extremes you can,
shakes.txt-113607-    But the strong base and building of my love
shakes.txt-113608-    Is as the very centre of the earth,
--
--
shakes.txt-113710-  TROILUS. Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
shakes.txt-113711-    For it is parting from us.
shakes.txt-113712-    I speak not 'Be thou true' as fearing thee,
shakes.txt:113713:    For I will throw my glove to Death himself
shakes.txt-113714-    That there's no maculation in thy heart;
shakes.txt-113715-    But 'Be thou true' say I to fashion in
shakes.txt-113716-    My sequent protestation: be thou true,
--
--
shakes.txt-113990-  AJAX. I thank thee, Hector.
shakes.txt-113991-    Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
shakes.txt-113992-    I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
shakes.txt:113993:    A great addition earned in thy death.
shakes.txt-113994-  HECTOR. Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
shakes.txt-113995-    On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
shakes.txt-113996-    Cries 'This is he' could promise to himself  
--
--
shakes.txt-114130-    We have had pelting wars since you refus'd
shakes.txt-114131-    The Grecians' cause.
shakes.txt-114132-  ACHILLES. Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
shakes.txt:114133:    To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
shakes.txt-114134-    To-night all friends.
shakes.txt-114135-  HECTOR. Thy hand upon that match.
shakes.txt-114136-  AGAMEMNON. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;  
--
--
shakes.txt-114912-  HECTOR. Most putrified core so fair without,

kjv.txt-2077-25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom

kjv.txt-29305-Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
kjv.txt-29306-when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I

kjv.txt:29372:unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at
kjv.txt:29373:this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD

kjv.txt-33494-15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
kjv.txt:33495:of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son
kjv.txt-33496-was over the house, judging the people of the land.

kjv.txt:34113:20:1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet

kjv.txt-36681-that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of
kjv.txt-36682-fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make
kjv.txt:36683:preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

kjv.txt-39024-
kjv.txt-39025-22:4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
kjv.txt:39026:Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to
kjv.txt-39027-his destruction.

kjv.txt-39215-house.

kjv.txt:39217:24:17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
kjv.txt-39218-made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

kjv.txt-39220-24:18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and

kjv.txt:39365:25:25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
kjv.txt-39366-of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
kjv.txt-39367-
kjv.txt-39368-25:26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are

kjv.txt-39456-out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD
kjv.txt-39457-had smitten him.
kjv.txt-39458-
kjv.txt:39459:26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
kjv.txt-39460-dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the
kjv.txt-39461-house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house,
kjv.txt-39462-judging the people of the land.

kjv.txt:40029:32:24 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
kjv.txt-40030-the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

kjv.txt-43521-dig for it more than for hid treasures; 3:22 Which rejoice
kjv.txt-43522-exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?  3:23 Why is
kjv.txt-43523-light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

kjv.txt:46157:7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he

kjv.txt-60712-
kjv.txt-60713-53:9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
kjv.txt:60714:death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his
kjv.txt-60715-mouth.
kjv.txt-60716-

kjv.txt-60726-53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
kjv.txt-60727-shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his
kjv.txt:60728:soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he

kjv.txt-63839-when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
kjv.txt-63840-26:22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the
kjv.txt-63841-son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.

kjv.txt-63846-
kjv.txt-63847-26:24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with

kjv.txt-63850-
kjv.txt-63851-27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king

kjv.txt-64940-
kjv.txt-64941-38:4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
kjv.txt:64942:this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men
kjv.txt-64943-of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in
kjv.txt-64944-speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of

kjv.txt-64983-
kjv.txt-64984-38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
kjv.txt:64985:wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt
kjv.txt-64986-thou not hearken unto me?  38:16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly
kjv.txt-64987-unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I

kjv.txt-64987-unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I
kjv.txt:64988:will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of
kjv.txt-64989-these men that seek thy life.
kjv.txt-64990-
kjv.txt-64991-38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God

kjv.txt-65022-38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
kjv.txt-65023-come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast
kjv.txt-65024-said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to
kjv.txt:65025:death; also what the king said unto thee: 38:26 Then thou shalt say
kjv.txt-65026-unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would

kjv.txt-65334-to sojourn there: 43:3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on
kjv.txt-65335-against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that
kjv.txt:65336:they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
kjv.txt-65337-
kjv.txt-65338-43:4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
kjv.txt-65339-and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the

kjv.txt-66385-
kjv.txt-66386-52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
kjv.txt-66387-bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison
kjv.txt:66388:till the day of his death.
kjv.txt-66389-
kjv.txt-66390-52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was

kjv.txt:66447:52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in

kjv.txt-79410-
kjv.txt-79411-26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought

kjv.txt-79429-heard his blasphemy.
kjv.txt-79430-
kjv.txt:79431:26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
kjv.txt-79432-
kjv.txt-79433-26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
kjv.txt-79434-smote him with the palms of their hands, 26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto

kjv.txt-79459-27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
kjv.txt:79460:the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 27:2 And
kjv.txt-79461-when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
kjv.txt-79462-Pontius Pilate the governor.
kjv.txt-79463-

kjv.txt-80185-5:22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
kjv.txt-80186-Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 5:23 And
kjv.txt-80187-besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of
kjv.txt:80188:death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be
kjv.txt-80189-healed; and she shall live.
kjv.txt-80190-
kjv.txt-80191-5:24 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
--
--
kjv.txt-80449-that ye may keep your own tradition.
kjv.txt-80450-
kjv.txt-80451-7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
kjv.txt:80452:curseth father or mother, let him die the death: 7:11 But ye say, If a
kjv.txt-80453-man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a
kjv.txt-80454-gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.

--
--
kjv.txt-80630-the holy angels.
kjv.txt-80631-
kjv.txt-80632-9:1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some
kjv.txt:80633:of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they
kjv.txt-80634-have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
kjv.txt-80635-
kjv.txt-80636-9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
--
--
kjv.txt-80872-And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things
kjv.txt-80873-should happen unto him, 10:33 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
kjv.txt-80874-and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto
kjv.txt:80875:the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver
kjv.txt-80876-him to the Gentiles: 10:34 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge
kjv.txt-80877-him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he
kjv.txt-80878-shall rise again.
--
--
kjv.txt-81193-whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is
kjv.txt-81194-not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
kjv.txt-81195-
kjv.txt:81196:13:12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
kjv.txt-81197-father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and
--
kjv.txt-81197-father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and
kjv.txt:81198:shall cause them to be put to death.
kjv.txt-81199-
kjv.txt-81200-13:13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that
kjv.txt-81201-shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
--
--
kjv.txt-81267-
kjv.txt-81268-14:1 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
kjv.txt-81269-bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might
kjv.txt:81270:take him by craft, and put him to death.
kjv.txt-81271-
kjv.txt-81272-14:2 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of
kjv.txt-81273-the people.
--
--
kjv.txt-81364-
kjv.txt-81365-14:33 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
kjv.txt-81366-sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 14:34 And saith unto them, My soul
kjv.txt:81367:is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
kjv.txt-81368-
kjv.txt-81369-14:35 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
kjv.txt-81370-that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
--
--
kjv.txt-81424-fire.
kjv.txt-81425-
kjv.txt-81426-14:55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
kjv.txt:81427:against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
kjv.txt-81428-
kjv.txt-81429-14:56 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
kjv.txt-81430-agreed not together.
--
--
kjv.txt-81446-
kjv.txt-81447-14:63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
kjv.txt-81448-any further witnesses?  14:64 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think
kjv.txt:81449:ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
kjv.txt-81450-
kjv.txt-81451-14:65 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
kjv.txt-81452-buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike
--
--
kjv.txt-81882-give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their
kjv.txt-81883-sins, 1:78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
kjv.txt-81884-from on high hath visited us, 1:79 To give light to them that sit in
kjv.txt:81885:darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of
kjv.txt-81886-peace.
kjv.txt-81887-
kjv.txt-81888-1:80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
--
--
kjv.txt-81960-Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
kjv.txt-81961-
kjv.txt-81962-2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
kjv.txt:81963:not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
kjv.txt-81964-
kjv.txt-81965-2:27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
kjv.txt-81966-brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
--
--
kjv.txt-82950-angels.
kjv.txt-82951-
kjv.txt-82952-9:27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
kjv.txt:82953:shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
kjv.txt-82954-
kjv.txt-82955-9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he
kjv.txt-82956-took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
--
--
kjv.txt-84109-
kjv.txt-84110-18:32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
kjv.txt-84111-mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 18:33 And they shall
kjv.txt:84112:scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise
kjv.txt-84113-again.
kjv.txt-84114-
kjv.txt-84115-18:34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
--
--
kjv.txt-84437-
kjv.txt-84438-21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
kjv.txt-84439-kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to
kjv.txt:84440:death.
kjv.txt-84441-
kjv.txt-84442-21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
kjv.txt-84443-
--
--
kjv.txt-84593-thy brethren.
kjv.txt-84594-
kjv.txt-84595-22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
kjv.txt:84596:into prison, and to death.
kjv.txt-84597-
kjv.txt-84598-22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
kjv.txt-84599-day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
--
--
kjv.txt-84742-man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having
kjv.txt-84743-examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching
kjv.txt-84744-those things whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I
kjv.txt:84745:sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
kjv.txt-84746-
kjv.txt-84747-23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
kjv.txt-84748-
--
--
kjv.txt-84755-23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
kjv.txt-84756-
kjv.txt-84757-23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
kjv.txt:84758:done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise
kjv.txt-84759-him, and let him go.
kjv.txt-84760-
kjv.txt-84761-23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might
--
--
kjv.txt-84787-
kjv.txt-84788-23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
kjv.txt-84789-in the dry?  23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led
kjv.txt:84790:with him to be put to death.
kjv.txt-84791-
kjv.txt-84792-23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
kjv.txt-84793-there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
--
--
kjv.txt-84907-things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which
kjv.txt-84908-was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
kjv.txt-84909-24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
kjv.txt:84910:condemned to death, and have crucified him.
kjv.txt-84911-
kjv.txt-84912-24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
kjv.txt-84913-Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these
--
--
kjv.txt-85439-
kjv.txt-85440-4:47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
kjv.txt-85441-went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his
kjv.txt:85442:son: for he was at the point of death.
kjv.txt-85443-
kjv.txt-85444-4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
kjv.txt-85445-will not believe.
--
--
kjv.txt-85537-
kjv.txt-85538-5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
kjv.txt-85539-believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
kjv.txt:85540:come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
kjv.txt-85541-
kjv.txt-85542-5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
kjv.txt-85543-when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that
--
--
kjv.txt-86078-judgeth.
kjv.txt-86079-
kjv.txt-86080-8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
kjv.txt:86081:never see death.
kjv.txt-86082-
kjv.txt-86083-8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
kjv.txt-86084-
--
--
kjv.txt-86083-8:52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
kjv.txt-86084-
kjv.txt-86085-Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my
kjv.txt:86086:saying, he shall never taste of death.
kjv.txt-86087-
kjv.txt-86088-8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
kjv.txt-86089-prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  8:54 Jesus answered, If
--
--
kjv.txt-86332-Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
kjv.txt-86333-thou lovest is sick.
kjv.txt-86334-
kjv.txt:86335:11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
kjv.txt-86336-but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
kjv.txt-86337-thereby.
kjv.txt-86338-
--
--
kjv.txt-86357-
kjv.txt-86358-11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
kjv.txt-86359-
kjv.txt:86360:11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
kjv.txt-86361-spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
kjv.txt-86362-
kjv.txt-86363-11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
--
--
kjv.txt-86469-one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
kjv.txt-86470-
kjv.txt-86471-11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
kjv.txt:86472:him to death.
kjv.txt-86473-
kjv.txt-86474-11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
kjv.txt-86475-thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
--
--
kjv.txt-86510-also, whom he had raised from the dead.
kjv.txt-86511-
kjv.txt-86512-12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
kjv.txt:86513:to death; 12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went
kjv.txt-86514-away, and believed on Jesus.
kjv.txt-86515-
kjv.txt-86516-12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
--
--
kjv.txt-86575-12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
kjv.txt-86576-me.
kjv.txt-86577-
kjv.txt:86578:12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.
kjv.txt-86579-
kjv.txt-86580-12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
kjv.txt-86581-Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be
--
--
kjv.txt-87188-
kjv.txt-87189-18:31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
kjv.txt-87190-to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us
kjv.txt:87191:to put any man to death: 18:32 That the saying of Jesus might be
kjv.txt:87192:fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.
kjv.txt-87193-
kjv.txt-87194-18:33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
kjv.txt-87195-Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  18:34 Jesus
--
--
kjv.txt-87514-shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall
kjv.txt-87515-gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
kjv.txt-87516-
kjv.txt:87517:21:19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
kjv.txt-87518-And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
kjv.txt-87519-
kjv.txt-87520-21:20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
--
--
kjv.txt-87674-did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 2:23 Him,
kjv.txt-87675-being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,
kjv.txt-87676-ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 2:24 Whom
kjv.txt:87677:God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was
kjv.txt-87678-not possible that he should be holden of it.
kjv.txt-87679-
kjv.txt-87680-2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
--
--
kjv.txt-88273-7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not
kjv.txt-88274-this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
kjv.txt-88275-
kjv.txt:88276:8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was
kjv.txt-88277-a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and
kjv.txt-88278-they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and
kjv.txt-88279-Samaria, except the apostles.
--
--
kjv.txt-88817-soldiers, what was become of Peter.
kjv.txt-88818-
kjv.txt-88819-12:19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
kjv.txt:88820:examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.
kjv.txt-88821-And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.
kjv.txt-88822-
kjv.txt-88823-12:20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
--
--
kjv.txt-88932-knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
kjv.txt-88933-sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
kjv.txt-88934-
kjv.txt:88935:13:28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
kjv.txt-88936-Pilate that he should be slain.
kjv.txt-88937-
kjv.txt-88938-13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
--
--
kjv.txt-89931-manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye
kjv.txt-89932-all are this day.
kjv.txt-89933-
kjv.txt:89934:22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
kjv.txt-89935-into prisons both men and women.
kjv.txt-89936-
kjv.txt-89937-22:5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
--
--
kjv.txt-89981-22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
kjv.txt-89982-synagogue them that believed on thee: 22:20 And when the blood of thy
kjv.txt-89983-martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto
kjv.txt:89984:his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
kjv.txt-89985-
kjv.txt-89986-22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto
kjv.txt-89987-the Gentiles.
--
--
kjv.txt-90111-23:28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
kjv.txt-90112-him, I brought him forth into their council: 23:29 Whom I perceived to
kjv.txt-90113-be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his
kjv.txt:90114:charge worthy of death or of bonds.
kjv.txt-90115-
kjv.txt-90116-23:30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
kjv.txt-90117-I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also
--
--
kjv.txt-90244-thou very well knowest.
kjv.txt-90245-
kjv.txt-90246-25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
kjv.txt:90247:death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things
kjv.txt-90248-whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal
kjv.txt-90249-unto Caesar.
kjv.txt-90250-
--
--
kjv.txt-90294-Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that
kjv.txt-90295-he ought not to live any longer.
kjv.txt-90296-
kjv.txt:90297:25:25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
kjv.txt-90298-and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to
kjv.txt-90299-send him.
kjv.txt-90300-
--
--
kjv.txt-90331-
kjv.txt-90332-26:10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
kjv.txt-90333-I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;
kjv.txt:90334:and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
kjv.txt-90335-
kjv.txt-90336-26:11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
kjv.txt-90337-to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted
--
--
kjv.txt-90397-26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
kjv.txt-90398-and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 26:31 And when they were
kjv.txt-90399-gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth
kjv.txt:90400:nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
kjv.txt-90401-
kjv.txt-90402-26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
kjv.txt-90403-liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
--
--
kjv.txt-90600-Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
kjv.txt-90601-
kjv.txt-90602-28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
kjv.txt:90603:there was no cause of death in me.
kjv.txt-90604-
kjv.txt-90605-28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
kjv.txt-90606-unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
--
--
kjv.txt-90731-disobedient to parents, 1:31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers,
kjv.txt-90732-without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 1:32 Who knowing
kjv.txt-90733-the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of
kjv.txt:90734:death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
kjv.txt-90735-
kjv.txt-90736-2:1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
kjv.txt-90737-judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
--
--
kjv.txt-90954-saved from wrath through him.
kjv.txt-90955-
kjv.txt-90956-5:10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
kjv.txt:90957:death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by
kjv.txt-90958-his life.
kjv.txt-90959-
kjv.txt-90960-5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
--
--
kjv.txt-90960-5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
kjv.txt-90961-Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

kjv.txt:90963:5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
kjv.txt:90964:sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 5:13

kjv.txt-90967-
kjv.txt:90968:5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
kjv.txt-90969-that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who

kjv.txt-90980-
kjv.txt:90981:5:17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they
kjv.txt-90982-which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
kjv.txt-90983-shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  5:18 Therefore as by the
kjv.txt-90984-offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by

kjv.txt-90990-
kjv.txt-90991-5:20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
kjv.txt-90992-where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 5:21 That as sin hath
kjv.txt:90993:reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
kjv.txt-90994-unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

kjv.txt-90996-6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
kjv.txt-90997-abound?  6:2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
kjv.txt-90998-longer therein?  6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized
kjv.txt:90999:into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  6:4 Therefore we are
kjv.txt:91000:buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised
kjv.txt-91001-up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
kjv.txt-91002-walk in newness of life.
kjv.txt-91003-

kjv.txt-91001-up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
kjv.txt-91002-walk in newness of life.
kjv.txt-91003-
kjv.txt:91004:6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
kjv.txt-91005-we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 6:6 Knowing
kjv.txt-91006-this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin
kjv.txt-91007-might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

kjv.txt-91011-6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
kjv.txt-91012-with him: 6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no
kjv.txt:91013:more; death hath no more dominion over him.
kjv.txt-91014-
kjv.txt-91015-6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he

kjv.txt:91035:his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
kjv.txt-91036-obedience unto righteousness?  6:17 But God be thanked, that ye were
kjv.txt-91037-the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
kjv.txt-91038-doctrine which was delivered you.

kjv.txt-91049-righteousness.
kjv.txt-91050-
kjv.txt-91051-6:21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
kjv.txt:91052:ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.
kjv.txt-91053-
kjv.txt-91054-6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye

kjv.txt:91057:6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
kjv.txt-91058-life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
kjv.txt-91059-
kjv.txt-91060-7:1 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
--

kjv.txt-91073-is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
kjv.txt-91074-
kjv.txt-91075-7:5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
kjv.txt:91076:the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
kjv.txt-91077-
kjv.txt-91078-7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
kjv.txt-91079-were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
--
--
kjv.txt-91090-came, sin revived, and I died.
kjv.txt-91091-
kjv.txt-91092-7:10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
kjv.txt:91093:unto death.
kjv.txt-91094-
kjv.txt-91095-7:11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
kjv.txt-91096-it slew me.
--
--
kjv.txt-91098-7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
kjv.txt-91099-and good.
kjv.txt-91100-
kjv.txt:91101:7:13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
kjv.txt:91102:sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is
kjv.txt-91103-good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
kjv.txt-91104-
kjv.txt-91105-7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
--
--
kjv.txt-91131-bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
kjv.txt-91132-
kjv.txt-91133-7:24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
kjv.txt:91134:this death?  7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then
kjv.txt-91135-with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the
kjv.txt-91136-law of sin.
kjv.txt-91137-
--
--
kjv.txt-91139-Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
kjv.txt-91140-
kjv.txt-91141-8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
kjv.txt:91142:free from the law of sin and death.
kjv.txt-91143-
kjv.txt-91144-8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
kjv.txt-91145-flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
--
--
kjv.txt-91150-8:5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
kjv.txt-91151-but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
kjv.txt-91152-
kjv.txt:91153:8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
kjv.txt-91154-is life and peace.
kjv.txt-91155-
kjv.txt-91156-8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
--
--
kjv.txt-91245-8:37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
kjv.txt-91246-that loved us.
kjv.txt-91247-
kjv.txt:91248:8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
kjv.txt-91249-principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
kjv.txt-91250-8:39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
kjv.txt-91251-separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
--
--
kjv.txt-92028-
kjv.txt-92029-3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
kjv.txt-92030-3:22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
kjv.txt:92031:death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's; 3:23 And
kjv.txt-92032-ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
kjv.txt-92033-
kjv.txt-92034-4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
--
--
kjv.txt-92059-God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
kjv.txt-92060-
kjv.txt-92061-4:9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
kjv.txt:92062:were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world,
kjv.txt-92063-and to angels, and to men.
kjv.txt-92064-
kjv.txt-92065-4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
--
--
kjv.txt-92576-as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
kjv.txt-92577-
kjv.txt-92578-11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
kjv.txt:92579:shew the Lord's death till he come.
kjv.txt-92580-
kjv.txt-92581-11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
kjv.txt-92582-the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
--
--
kjv.txt-92885-15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
kjv.txt-92886-firstfruits of them that slept.
kjv.txt-92887-
kjv.txt:92888:15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
kjv.txt-92889-of the dead.
kjv.txt-92890-
kjv.txt-92891-15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
--
--
kjv.txt-92900-
kjv.txt-92901-15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
kjv.txt-92902-
kjv.txt:92903:15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
kjv.txt-92904-
kjv.txt-92905-15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
kjv.txt-92906-things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which
--
--
kjv.txt-92977-
kjv.txt-92978-15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
kjv.txt-92979-this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
kjv.txt:92980:pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
kjv.txt-92981-
--
kjv.txt-92981-
kjv.txt:92982:15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
kjv.txt:92983:15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
kjv.txt-92984-
kjv.txt-92985-15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
kjv.txt-92986-Lord Jesus Christ.
--
--
kjv.txt-93087-1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
kjv.txt-93088-came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
kjv.txt-93089-strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 1:9 But we had the
kjv.txt:93090:sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,
kjv.txt-93091-but in God which raiseth the dead: 1:10 Who delivered us from so great
--
kjv.txt-93091-but in God which raiseth the dead: 1:10 Who delivered us from so great
kjv.txt:93092:a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
kjv.txt-93093-us; 1:11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
kjv.txt-93094-bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
kjv.txt-93095-many on our behalf.
--
--
kjv.txt-93176-
kjv.txt-93177-2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
kjv.txt-93178-saved, and in them that perish: 2:16 To the one we are the savour of
kjv.txt:93179:death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And
kjv.txt-93180-who is sufficient for these things?  2:17 For we are not as many,
kjv.txt-93181-which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in
kjv.txt-93182-the sight of God speak we in Christ.
--
--
kjv.txt-93195-the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the
kjv.txt-93196-letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
kjv.txt-93197-
kjv.txt:93198:3:7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
kjv.txt-93199-was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
kjv.txt-93200-behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory
kjv.txt-93201-was to be done away: 3:8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit
--
--
kjv.txt-93256-dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made
kjv.txt-93257-manifest in our body.
kjv.txt-93258-
kjv.txt:93259:4:11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
kjv.txt-93260-that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
kjv.txt-93261-flesh.
kjv.txt-93262-
--
--
kjv.txt-93260-that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
kjv.txt-93261-flesh.
kjv.txt-93262-
kjv.txt:93263:4:12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
kjv.txt-93264-
kjv.txt-93265-4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
kjv.txt-93266-believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
--
--
kjv.txt-93416-might receive damage by us in nothing.
kjv.txt-93417-
kjv.txt-93418-7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
kjv.txt:93419:repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
kjv.txt-93420-
kjv.txt-93421-7:11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
kjv.txt-93422-sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of

kjv.txt-93680-
kjv.txt-93681-11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
kjv.txt-93682-labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more
kjv.txt:93683:frequent, in deaths oft.
kjv.txt-93684-
kjv.txt-93685-11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

kjv.txt-94654-prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 1:20 According
kjv.txt-94655-to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be
kjv.txt-94656-ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ
kjv.txt:94657:shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
kjv.txt-94658-
kjv.txt-94659-1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
kjv.txt-94660-
--
--
kjv.txt-94696-being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
kjv.txt-94697-2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
kjv.txt-94698-servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 2:8 And being found in
kjv.txt:94699:fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
kjv.txt:94700:even the death of the cross.
kjv.txt-94701-
kjv.txt-94702-2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
kjv.txt-94703-which is above every name: 2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee
--
--
kjv.txt-94747-2:26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
kjv.txt-94748-that ye had heard that he had been sick.
kjv.txt-94749-
kjv.txt:94750:2:27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;
kjv.txt-94751-and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
kjv.txt-94752-sorrow.
kjv.txt-94753-
--
--
kjv.txt-94756-
kjv.txt-94757-2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
kjv.txt-94758-such in reputation: 2:30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh
kjv.txt:94759:unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service
kjv.txt-94760-toward me.
kjv.txt-94761-
kjv.txt-94762-3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
--
--
kjv.txt-94783-of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
kjv.txt-94784-righteousness which is of God by faith: 3:10 That I may know him, and
kjv.txt-94785-the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
kjv.txt:94786:being made conformable unto his death; 3:11 If by any means I might
kjv.txt-94787-attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
kjv.txt-94788-
kjv.txt-94789-3:12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
--
--
kjv.txt-94941-
kjv.txt-94942-1:21  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
kjv.txt-94943-wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
kjv.txt:94944:1:22  In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
kjv.txt-94945-unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
kjv.txt-94946-1:23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
kjv.txt-94947-away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached
--
--
kjv.txt-95855-with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
kjv.txt-95856-own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
kjv.txt-95857-world began, 1:10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our
kjv.txt:95858:Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life
kjv.txt-95859-and immortality to light through the gospel: 1:11 Whereunto I am
kjv.txt-95860-appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
kjv.txt-95861-
--
--
kjv.txt-96299-But now we see not yet all things put under him.
kjv.txt-96300-
kjv.txt-96301-2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
kjv.txt:96302:the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the
kjv.txt:96303:grace of God should taste death for every man.
kjv.txt-96304-
kjv.txt-96305-2:10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
kjv.txt-96306-things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
--
--
kjv.txt-96315-the children which God hath given me.
kjv.txt-96316-
kjv.txt-96317-2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
kjv.txt:96318:he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
kjv.txt:96319:might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
kjv.txt:96320:2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
kjv.txt-96321-lifetime subject to bondage.
kjv.txt-96322-
kjv.txt-96323-2:16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took

--
kjv.txt-96448-
kjv.txt-96449-5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
kjv.txt-96450-supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
kjv.txt:96451:save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 5:8 Though he
kjv.txt-96452-were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
kjv.txt-96453-5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
kjv.txt-96454-unto all them that obey him; 5:10 Called of God an high priest after
--
--
kjv.txt-96582-Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
kjv.txt-96583-
kjv.txt-96584-7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered
kjv.txt:96585:to continue by reason of death: 7:24 But this man, because he
kjv.txt-96586-continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
kjv.txt-96587-
kjv.txt-96588-7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
--
--
kjv.txt-96680-flesh: 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
kjv.txt-96681-eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
kjv.txt-96682-conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  9:15 And for this
kjv.txt:96683:cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death,
kjv.txt-96684-for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
kjv.txt-96685-testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
kjv.txt-96686-inheritance.
--
--
kjv.txt-96686-inheritance.
kjv.txt-96687-
kjv.txt-96688-9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
kjv.txt:96689:death of the testator.
kjv.txt-96690-
kjv.txt-96691-9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is
kjv.txt-96692-of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

kjv.txt-96842-
kjv.txt:96843:11:5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
kjv.txt-96844-was not found, because God had translated him: for before his
kjv.txt-96845-translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
